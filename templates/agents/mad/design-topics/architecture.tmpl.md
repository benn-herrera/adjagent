# TOPIC: Architecture Design

## Domain

Software architecture construction for difficult systems: package and module structure, abstraction
boundaries, layering, coupling, interface contracts, data flow, state ownership, and failure-mode
handling for problems that do not have a standard, well-trodden solution.
@!mad-design-external-authority basis="the provided problem statement, requirements, and any invariant document" imports="Established patterns (*the way framework X does it*, *the canonical pattern for Y*)"!@

This topic is for systems where the structural decisions are non-obvious — novel data flows,
cross-cutting concerns, hard performance/safety/portability constraints, or hybrid requirements that
resist any single off-the-shelf pattern. It is not for greenfield CRUD-shaped problems where the
answer is "the usual thing."

## Constructive Architecture, Adversarially Defended

The proposal must include, at minimum:

- **Module / package decomposition** with the responsibility of each unit stated in one sentence
- **Key abstractions and interface contracts** between units — what each interface carries, what it
  deliberately does not, and what behavioral guarantees it makes
- **Layering and dependency direction** — which units depend on which, and why the direction is
  consistent
- **Data flow and state ownership** — where each piece of state lives, who is allowed to mutate it,
  and how it crosses boundaries
- **Failure-mode handling** — where errors are produced, where they are handled, and where they
  cross system boundaries
- **Cost / capability accounting** for each non-trivial structural decision: what hard problem it
  solves, what cheaper structure was considered and rejected, and why the cheaper structure fails

### Attack Surface

Identify unjustified abstractions, hidden coupling, abstraction inversions, leaky contracts,
pattern-for-its-own-sake, premature configurability, structural complexity that does not pay rent,
separation-of-concerns violations disguised as helpers, and decisions that close doors the
requirements say must remain open. Defend your own architecture against the same attacks by naming
what hard problem each structure solves and why a simpler structure fails to solve it.

## Convergence Criteria

Architecture problems usually admit a small family of valid solutions rather than a single right
answer. Convergence here is about whether participants agree on the structure of the solution space
and on a specific point within it — or, when they do not, on a clear diagnosis of why.

A successful debate terminates in one of these states:

- **(a) Structural convergence**: all active participants converge on the same module decomposition,
  the same key interface contracts, the same layering and dependency direction, and the same
  data/state ownership boundaries — modulo trivial naming or grouping differences. The architecture
  is the deliverable.
@!mad-design-multipath-convergence result="structural decisions" paths="reasoning paths (different driving constraints invoked, different rejected alternatives, but the same final structure)"!@
- **(c) Tradeoff under-determination**: all active participants converge on the same
  characterization of the design space — same Pareto frontier, same set of viable architectures,
  same axes of tradeoff (e.g., latency vs. flexibility, simplicity vs. extensibility) — but cannot
  select a single point on the frontier from the supplied requirements. The frontier
  characterization and the specific missing requirement that would close the choice are the
  deliverable.
- **(d) Constraint under-determination**: all active participants converge on the same diagnosis
  that the problem cannot be closed from the supplied requirements at all, and identify the specific
  missing constraint, invariant, capability target, or stakeholder decision required. The diagnostic
  statement is the deliverable.

## What This Topic Is Not

- This is not architecture *review* of an existing system.
- This is not implementation-level design. Findings about magic strings, error-handling style, or
  local DRY belong in code review, not here.
- This is not a search for an elegant pattern. A pattern is justified only if it removes a harder
  complexity than it introduces.
- This is not greenfield boilerplate. Reserve this process for problems where the structural
  decisions are genuinely non-obvious and the cost of getting them wrong is high.

## How to Report Proposals and Findings

Tradeoff disagreements should be framed as "this choice optimizes axis X at cost to axis Y; the
requirements weigh X higher" — not as right/wrong.
