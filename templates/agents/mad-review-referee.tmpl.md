- **Review charter**: the invoker's verbatim instruction text — what to review and against what
  standard. Review mode has no topic library, so this is the whole methodology a seat receives; an
  invocation naming no topic file is complete, not defective
- **Artifact path**: the specific material under review

### The finding budget — guidance for the invoker, not referee behavior

A review charter should cap how many findings a seat reports, so that the arbitration queue stays
readable. **12 per seat is the suggested default.** A cap wants a coverage note beside it — required
in every review, not only where something was cut — so that a truncated review does not read as a
complete one, and so that a defect one seat judged not worth reporting is visible to a seat other
than its author. The charter says what such a note holds; that is not yours to specify.

You neither set the number nor enforce it. Where a charter names no budget, that is the invoker's
choice and not a defect to correct.

## Phase 1 — Independent Assessment

**Dispatch** (binding):

@!mad-guest-dispatch-ordering!@

@!mad-phase1-dispatch-lead charter="charter" dir="mad-review/[review-name]"!@
- The referee-instructions file path
- The artifact (path or content)
- The requirements document path, if provided — reviewers must treat it as the authoritative source
  of invariants to validate against

@!mad-seat-failure-continues final="SUMMARY.md" degraded="findings, not a debate"!@

## Phase 2 — Initial Alignment

Dispatch AA with:
- The referee-instructions file path
@!mad-phase2-aa-dispatch outputs="reviews"!@

@!mad-write-access-halt!@

Write `initial-findings.md` (see Document Format).

Update session state. Proceed to Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Debate Rounds (maximum 5)

**Step 1 — Dispatch seats**

@!mad-round-instructions-write points="the points to address" dir="mad-review/[review-name]"!@

**A round carries two kinds of point, and omitting the second is how a sound finding dies
unconfirmed.** Contested points, which need argument; and **points short a stance**, which need only
that a seat read and take one. A point two seats found independently and a third never addressed is
not agreed, not contested, and — if no round ever puts it — not retirable either.

- A **live point** is any entry the current map carries that is not already retired — every section
  of it, whatever the assessor headed the entry. An entry it labels a shared premise or a flagged
  ambiguity is a live point like any other: deciding that an entry is not really a finding is a
  content call, and your authority is process.
- A live point is **short a stance from seat S** when the map records anything other than a position
  explicitly attributed to S. The map's vocabulary for this varies — *silent*, *omission*, *implicit
  disagreement*, *raised as a coverage note* — and all of it means the same thing here: no stance.
  Neither an implicit disagreement nor a coverage note is a position.
- **Every round carries every unretired live point**, and the instruction text says of each whether
  it is contested or short a stance, so a seat spends argument only where argument is wanted. Seats
  stance every live point every round; a stance is a statement about this round, and the gate reads
  this round's.
- **A no-stance point carries what the seat needs to answer in one round**: the raising seat's cited
  locations, and the answers admitted. Quote the raising seat's Conclusions entry or the map's
  description of it — never paraphrase, because a summary of a finding is where its framing leaks.
  An abstention on such a point must say what would settle it.

@!mad-aa-misclassification seats="Reviewers" unit="finding" initial="assessment" gate="retirement" seat="reviewer"!@

**Step 2 — Apply retirement gate**

@!mad-explicit-stance!@

@!mad-gate-unanimity!@

1. @!mad-gate-plain-language-check sameness="resolution" agreement="agreement"!@

2. @!mad-gate-implication-test premise="[resolution] is true" aspect="artifact" outcome="resolution"!@

3. **Gate passes**: mark the point retired. Tag as `[Conceded by <seat>]` naming the conceding seat
   (or several, comma-separated), or `[Mutual Agreement]` when no seat had to move.
   `[Initial Agreement]` or `[Eventual Agreement]` from the AA map carries forward.

4. @!mad-gate-fails!@

@!mad-partial-concessions seat="reviewer" steps="1–2"!@

@!mad-round-aa-update!@

**Step 4 — Check end conditions**

- **End condition 1**: every live point is either retired by the gate, or has this round been
  stanced by **every** active seat without the gate retiring it. A point no seat contests but one
  has never addressed is **not** resolved, and a run that ends on it spends a human's judgement on a
  question a spare round would have answered. Proceed to Phase 4.
  - `abstain` is a stance and satisfies this condition, but retires nothing. A point every seat has
    stanced that the gate has not retired — including one carried by abstentions — goes to the human
    arbitration queue with the reason recorded, exactly as a contested point does.
- **End condition 2**: 5 rounds completed. Proceed to Phase 4; every point short of end condition 1
  goes to the human arbitration queue.
- Otherwise: increment round counter, return to Step 1.

Update session state at each transition.

## Phase 4 — Output Documents

Write `SUMMARY.md` (see Document Format).

@!mad-final-doc-actionable final="SUMMARY.md"!@

## Retirement Gate — Meta Rules

@!mad-gate-meta-lead!@

**Your role**: you are testing comprehensibility, not correctness. You do not decide whether the
retired position is technically right. You decide whether it is coherent and mutually understood.

### Output Paths

All output files are written to `mad-review/[review-name]/`:

| Document | Filename | Audience |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Session state | `debate-session-state.md` | referee |
| Per-seat initial assessment | `<seat>-assessment.md` | that seat only |
| Per-seat round response | `<seat>-round-[N].md` | that seat only |
| Alignment map | `aa-initial-map.md`, `aa-round-[N]-map.md` | all seats |
| Initial findings *(aggregate)* | `initial-findings.md` | human — never a seat |
| Round N *(aggregate)* | `round-[N].md` | human — never a seat |
| Final summary | `SUMMARY.md` | human |

### `SUMMARY.md`

```
# Review Summary — [Review Name]

## Burndown List
Agreed actionable items. Address these.

| Finding | Agreement Type | Round Reached |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| [description] | Initial / Eventual | — / N |

## Human Arbitration Queue
Unresolved points after all debate rounds. Require human judgment.

One position column per active seat, in roster order — the header row is built from the roster, so a three-seat run has three position columns and a five-seat run has five. A seat that took no position gets `—` (not silence), and the Notes column says which kind of silence it was: **never asked** — no round put the point to that seat — or **abstained**, which is a judgement it made. A reader weighing a finding needs to know whether the gap is the seat's or the process's.

| Finding | `<seat-1>` Position | `<seat-2>` Position | ... | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|-------|
| [description] | [position] | [position] | ... | [gate failure reason or rounds exhausted] |

## Retired Actionables
Items initially flagged as actionable but withdrawn through the concession mechanism.
These were investigated and resolved — do not reopen without new information.

| Finding | Raised By | Retired By | Round | Plain-Language Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|--------------------------|
| [description] | [seat name] | [Conceded by <seat>] / [Mutual Agreement] | N | [resolution] |
