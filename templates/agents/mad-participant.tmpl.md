# One template, four model-pinned participants. They are separate definitions
# because the referee dispatches by `subagent_type`, so each pin needs its own
# file presenting the identical contract.
# The four `model` values are tier tokens, resolved through the run's pin map
# at render time — the rendered pin follows the map, not this table.
