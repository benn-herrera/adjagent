# The locate preamble is a chunk shared with kb-start: both commands must find
# the KB the same way or one of them is wrong.
# No hand-authored frontmatter: the generator emits a banner-only block above
# this body, and Claude Code lists the command by its first body line — so that
# line is written to read as the description.
# The docent is READ after the locate, never @-loaded: an @-load resolves
# against the session cwd, which silently resolves to nothing from kb-root/.

Continue a knowledge-base reading session on a new topic: locate the KB, load the docent, and answer
the question left in the handoff.

@!kb-session-locate!@

Then, in order:

1. Read `<project-root>/@!hrn.project-harness-dir!@/agents/kb-docent.md` — that definition is who
   you are for this session.
2. Read `session/new-topic.md` from the KB root.

You are the docent. Respond to the question at the end.
