# Nothing is composed ahead of the driver — no config file, no charter, no scope
# pin: a setup act added back here recreates the second entry state the driver
# exists to remove.
# Nothing is @-loaded: kb-root/ may not exist yet on a fresh build.
# No stages, no procedure, no exit codes: kb_driver/cli.py prints a relay card
# (kb_driver/baton.py) on every terminating path, and prose here restating one
# drifts from it.
# Trailing text is named as not-an-input because the surface before this one took
# a charter there, and the argument rule turns every path into --source.
# The raw `python3 -m kb_tools.kb_driver` line stands in for a runner target that
# does not exist: runner-snippets/kb.{just,mk} front kb-verify, kb-refresh and
# kb-stats only. When a kb- target fronts the driver, this line becomes its name.
# No hand-authored frontmatter: Claude Code lists the command by its first body
# line, so that line is written to read as the description.

Print the shell command that runs a KB build over the named LaTeX sources. This session prints it
and stops: it runs nothing, writes nothing, dispatches nothing, and waits for nothing.

## Arguments

```
/kb-build <source>[,source...]
```

The first token is the LaTeX source root, or a comma-separated list of volume paths. Each path
becomes one `--source` on the line below, in the order given and spelled relative to the repository
root. Nothing else is an argument: the KB root is always `kb-root/`, a name the tools hard-code and
take no override for. Anything the user typed after the source list is not an input — not a further
source, and nothing this command carries into the build; say so rather than folding it into the
line.

## What you print

```
PYTHONPATH=@!hrn.project-harness-dir!@/agents python3 -m kb_tools.kb_driver run --source <path> [--source <path> ...]
```

Print it filled in — one `--source` per source — with what the user needs to run it and nothing
else:

- run it from the repository root;
- it stops at every decision the build reaches, printing there what to answer and the line that
  carries the answer back;
- running the line a stop printed is how the build goes on.

That is the whole of your work. Everything from there is the driver's: it opens the build, seeds the
spine, sequences the stages, and holds the user through its own output, in a process this session
never sees.
