End the active guest-model session pointer.

## Behavior

1. If `guest-session/active-topic.txt` does not exist, report: `"No active guest session."` and
   stop.

2. Otherwise, read the topic name from `guest-session/active-topic.txt`, then remove the file:
   ```bash
   rm guest-session/active-topic.txt
   ```

3. The session directory `guest-session/<topic>/` (containing `messages.json`, `params.env`, and
   `tmp/`) is **preserved as audit history**. Do not delete it. The user can resume later by running
   `/guest-start <topic>` and choosing **resume**.

4. Confirm to the user:
   `"Guest session '<topic>' ended. Audit log preserved at guest-session/<topic>/messages.json. Use /guest-start <topic> to resume."`
