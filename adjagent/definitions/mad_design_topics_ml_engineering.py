_DOMAIN = r"""# TOPIC: ML Engineering

## Domain

Complex problem solving, technique research, and exploration in machine learning systems —
particularly inference, training, sampling, attention, optimization, quantization, distillation, and
novel inference-time mechanics. The space includes designing new techniques, adapting published ones
to non-standard regimes, diagnosing model behavior, and exploring open questions where the answer is
not yet known and may require empirical validation to resolve."""

_INTRO = r"""The choice between viable techniques frequently depends on empirical outcomes that reasoning cannot
predetermine. Convergence here is about whether participants agree on the proposed technique and on
a path to validate it — or, when they do not, on a clear diagnosis of why."""

_CONVERGED = r"""- **(a) Mechanism convergence**: all active participants converge on the same proposed technique,
  the same hypothesized mechanism, the same predicted observable behavior, and the same measurement
  plan — modulo trivial reformulation. The technique specification is the deliverable."""

_EMPIRICAL = r"""- **(c) Empirical under-determination**: all active participants converge on the same
  characterization of the candidate space — same set of viable techniques, same hypothesized
  mechanism for each, same predicted distinguishing measurements — but cannot select among them
  without running the experiment that distinguishes them. The candidate set, the distinguishing
  experiment, and the decision criterion are the deliverable. **Running the experiment IS the
  resolution** — this outcome is productive, not a failure."""

_THEORETICAL = r"""- **(d) Theoretical under-determination**: all active participants converge on the same diagnosis
  that the problem cannot be closed from the supplied context — missing baseline, missing prior
  measurement, missing model-behavior characterization, or missing constraint. The diagnostic
  statement is the deliverable."""

_EXPERIMENT_AND_REST = r"""When the resolution path is "run the experiment," the experiment specification must be concrete
enough that a human or downstream agent can execute it without reinterpreting the proposal: specify
the prompt set or dataset, the baseline configuration, the metric, the threshold for
accepting/rejecting the hypothesis, and the failure modes that would invalidate the experiment
itself.

## What This Topic Is Not

- This is not architecture design.
- This is not formal derivation.
- This is not implementation. Findings about specific code patterns, error handling, or local DRY
  belong in code review.
- This is not a place to reach for novelty. If a well-established technique solves the problem, the
  strongest proposal is "use the established technique, here is why its conditions transfer."
  Novelty is a cost, not a virtue.

## How to Report Proposals and Findings

In debate rounds, the specific element an attack or defense turns on is a tensor or operation in the
mechanism, a claim in the justification, a metric in the measurement plan, or a cost line in the
accounting.

Tradeoff and uncertainty disagreements should be framed as "this proposal optimizes for X (e.g.,
compute) at cost to Y (e.g., flexibility); the problem prioritizes X" — not as right/wrong. When the
disagreement reduces to "we won't know until we measure," that is the signal for empirical
under-determination convergence, not for continued argumentation."""
