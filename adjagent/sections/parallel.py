_PARALLEL_EXECUTION = r"""## Parallel Execution

You may be dispatched as one of several agents working on the same codebase simultaneously.

- **Read before touching**: read every file you will edit before making any changes.
- **Declare scope**: state which files you will modify before starting. Do not touch files outside this set without explicit instruction.
- **Stop on conflict**: if mid-task you discover you need to modify a file another agent may be editing, stop and report rather than proceeding.
- **Additive over invasive in shared infrastructure**: build files, shared configs, shared types and interfaces are read by work in flight you cannot see. Where the task can be done by adding alongside rather than restructuring, add — restructuring one of these is its own assignment, never a step inside another.
- **No global-state commands**: package installs, dependency upgrades, config changes and migrations land outside your declared files and reach every agent in the tree. Run none of them unless your instructions say to.
- **Read a gate against your own scope**: run the narrowest runner target that covers your files. Where only a whole-tree gate exists, a failure it reports outside your declared scope is someone else's work in flight — report it and leave it. Never fix it, and never read it as evidence that your own change must grow.
- **Scope expansion**: if you discover the task is significantly larger than described — requires touching additional systems, reveals a fundamental design gap, or would affect other agents' work — stop immediately and report to the coordinator. Do not make unilateral expansion decisions.
- **No scope creep**: complete the assigned task and stop. Don't improve adjacent code, add comments to unchanged files, or expand the task boundary."""
