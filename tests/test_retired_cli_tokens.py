"""The retired CLI surface appears nowhere.

`kb_util`'s nine action flags became subcommands in one change, with no
compatibility shim and no deprecation window — the requirement was **no period
of two conventions on one tool**. A grep run once while making that change is
evidence for the change; it is not a guard for the repository. This file is the
guard: it re-runs the sweep on every test run, so a doc, a card, a recipe or a
brief that re-acquires an old spelling is caught here rather than by whoever
next runs the command it advertises. A retired *command* joins the same guard
for the same reason: `mint_claim_ids` left the agent-facing surface with mint
fusion, and it had no standing sweep until this one.

It reads the source trees, never `rendered/`: the templates are what a render is
a function of, and `rendered/` is a gitignored build product that may be absent
or stale (the same bound `test_manifest_views_in_definitions.py` states).

Out of scope, deliberately, and only these: `mad-design/` and `ROADMAP.md` are
design history — the plan that retired these tokens has to be able to name them
— `kb_tools/_vendor/` is third-party source this repository never edits, and
this file is the token list's one legitimate home.

#: module invocation (`kb-maintainer.md`, `kb_driver/run.py`) and the filename
#: (`CONVENTIONS.md`'s tool table, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
#:
#: The bare identifier is deliberately *not* a token. Naming a retired command
#: in prose about its retirement is legitimate and current
#: (`kb_write/ops.py:304`, `tests/test_mint_and_scan.py:334`); what may not
#: come back is an instruction to invoke it, and an invocation cannot be
#: written without one of these two spellings.

#: `--initial-guess`, and so each token is reported under its own name. A left

#: the `.` and the `-m ` an invocation puts in front of them while refusing a
