"""No agent definition is sent to the manifest file directly (V5.3.5, arch-W2).

``manifest.py``'s views reach a seat through brief slots, never through a seat
opening the JSON itself. This file is the check for that: it reads
``templates/`` rather than ``rendered/``, since the templates are the source a
render is a function of and ``rendered/`` is a gitignored build product that
may be absent or stale.

There is no per-seat view assertion here: the one seat that worked from the
manifest by verb (``render-manifest section-index``) was ``kb-latex-specialist``,
retired with the LaTeX-reading survey pipeline it served.
