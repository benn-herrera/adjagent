"""No file hand-composes a metadata marker.

`kb_write.render` is the only writer of a `<!-- id:`, `<!-- kb-frontmatter` or
`<!-- claim-quality:` opener. The prose sweep that removed the freehand sites
is evidence for that change; it is not a guard for the repository, and its
finding list is not something a reviewer re-checks on every future edit. This
file is the guard, in two halves:

* **The template surface** — every file under `templates/` and
  `kb_tools/installed/`. The third tree carrying brief text,
  `kb_tools/kb_driver/prompt-templates/`, is `prompt_templates.lint`'s half:
  the tokens ride in ``steps.TEMPLATE_PROHIBITIONS`` and
  ``test_kb_driver_prompt_templates.test_the_shipped_template_directory_lints_clean``
  runs the lint over the shipped templates. The patterns below are that same
  compiled map, sliced — one token vocabulary, two walks.
* **The code surface** — every `.py` under `kb_tools/` outside
  `kb_write/`. "`render.py` is the only module composing a marker" is a
  negative constraint, and a negative constraint with no instrument is a wish.

**Token-bearing files are allowlisted by name, with a reason**
(:data:`MARKER_ALLOWLIST`) — five readers of the format, plus the module that
spells the tokens for the lint that matches them.
Composing a marker and reading one are indistinguishable to a line scanner —
`CANONICAL_ID = re.compile(r"<!-- id: ...")` and a docstring describing the
band it parses both carry the literal — so the discrimination is a human
judgement recorded once per file rather than a cleverness re-derived per line.
Two properties keep the list honest: it is per-file and therefore visible in a
diff, and
:func:`test_every_allowlisted_reader_still_carries_a_marker_token` fails on an
entry whose file no longer carries a token, so an entry cannot outlive its
reason. What it does *not* buy: a new composition added to an allowlisted
reader is not caught here. That file's own review is what catches it, and
widening the list is the cost of not maintaining a per-line ledger.

Out of scope, deliberately: `kb_tools/_vendor/` (third-party source this
repository never edits), `kb_tools/tests/` — fixtures *and* test modules —
because a register fixture and a test's expected output are data, not writers;
`mad-design/` and `ROADMAP.md`, which are not under either root; and
`rendered/`, a gitignored build product (the same bound
`test_retired_cli_tokens.py` states).
