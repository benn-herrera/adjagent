"""The traversal-obligation sweep over the rendered KB agent set.

Graph traversal sits off the inference side: coverage, tiling, containment, the
tree diff and reachability are the validator's, proved and logged.
That no definition still *asks a seat* to perform one of those walks is an
exhaustiveness claim, and an exhaustiveness claim with no mechanical check is a
wish. This file is that check.

**How it reads.** Every line of every rendered ``kb-*`` definition is matched
against :data:`PATTERNS` — the four traversal-obligation shapes. Each hit
must match exactly one entry of :data:`JUDGMENT_SITES`, whose value says why the
site's object is a *judgment* (does this index distinguish its children?) rather
than a *resolution* (does this link resolve?). A new theater site fails by not
being in the map; a site that leaves fails by leaving its entry stale.

**Two stated bounds.**

*Scope*: the KB agent set, rendered — the definitions a KB build dispatches, and
the only ones that can carry an obligation over the KB's link graph. The same
verbs elsewhere in ``agents/`` name other objects entirely (a derivation chain, a
doc's reading path, ownership flow), and sweeping them would grow an allowlist
that says nothing about this claim.

*Rendering*: definitions are rendered in memory from ``templates/``, not read out
of ``rendered/``, which is a gitignored build product that may be absent or stale.
The templates are the source the render is a function of, so the sweep sees what
the next render would write.

The sweep's first run found one resolution-object site — the taxonomy
architect's Review Mode navigability item — and held it in an ``OPEN_FINDINGS``
map asserted as *still present*, so that fixing it turned this file red. It is
fixed and the map is gone with it. A finding held that way again is
restored from history complete with its still-present assertion: an exemption
map that nothing asserts against would let a site out of :data:`JUDGMENT_SITES`
silently, which is the failure this sweep exists to prevent.
