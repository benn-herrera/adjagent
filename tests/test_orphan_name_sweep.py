"""No module-level name in the shipped `kb_tools` package is unreferenced.

A constant, function or class whose only occurrence in the repository is its own
definition is either dead — stranded when its last caller left — or a deliberate
exception the next reader has to be told about. Neither is visible to the
interpreter or to the suite: nothing imports a stranded name, so nothing breaks,
and it survives every green run until somebody happens to read the module. A
one-off script found a stranded marker pattern in the driver that way once, and
its output was read rather than obeyed, because a re-export and a test-only
helper are unreferenced for good reasons. This file is the standing form. The
difference is
:data:`CLASSIFIED`: every orphan is named there with the reason it is one, and an
orphan that is not named fails.

**The corpus is the repository's own source, from git.** Not a directory walk:
this tree carries at least three byte-copies of `kb_tools/` — the installed
surface under `.claude/agents/`, the `rendered/` build product, and the
transient install targets under `kb-testing/test-data/` — and every one of them
is gitignored. A walk that reached them found *zero* orphans, because a stale
copy still holds the caller that the live tree deleted; that is a silent pass,
which is the worst failure a sweep can have. `git ls-files` plus untracked,
non-ignored files is exactly "the source this repository maintains", and it
excludes every copy by construction rather than by a skip list that the next
copy tree would defeat. :func:`test_the_corpus_holds_no_copy_of_the_swept_tree`
is what says so on each run.

**Three stated bounds.**

*What is swept*: `.py` under `kb_tools/`, less `_vendor/` (third-party source
this repository never edits) and `kb_tools/tests/` (a test function is called by
pytest and a fixture is data — sweeping them would fill the table with the test
tree and say nothing about the shipped package).

*What counts as a name*: a top-level `def`, `async def`, `class`, `x = ...` or
`x: T = ...` — the module's own namespace and not one line deeper. Names opening
with `__` are out: the interpreter calls those.

*What counts as a reference*: an occurrence of the identifier anywhere in the
corpus, prose and string literals included. So a name reached by string dispatch
counts as referenced, and so does one merely discussed in `ARCHITECTURE.md` —
both are things that break when it goes. The cost is collisions: a module-level
`build` would be masked by any other `build` in the repository. The sweep
therefore under-reports and never over-reports, which is the safe direction for
something whose findings a person has to adjudicate.
