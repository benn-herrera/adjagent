# ARCHITECTURE – liaison_tools

How the helpers in `liaison_tools/` are built to satisfy SPEC.md. Cites SPEC's requirements rather
than restating them; where this document and SPEC disagree, SPEC wins and this document is the
defect.

## Module Inventory

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `post-openai.py` | The wire transport. Builds and POSTs one SSE-streamed chat-completions request, demuxes and reassembles the stream, classifies the outcome (complete / incomplete / empty / error), and emits the canonical stdout contract. |
| `msg-util.py` | The messages-file mutator. Three modes (`init`/`append`/`validate`) over a JSON turn array, with a lock + scratch-file + atomic-replace discipline protecting concurrent read-modify-write. |
| `relay-driver.py` | The corpus-relay eval instrument. Composes `post-openai.py` and `msg-util.py` into a scripted, budgeted READ/LIST/GREP question-answering loop against a read-only corpus. |
| `__init__.py` | Package marker only, so `tests/` collects under a stable module path. The tools themselves are hyphenated — not legal module names — so nothing in the package imports another; each is a command, and the tests load the ones they exercise by file path through `importlib`. |
| `tests/` | The verification suite (see Test Layout, below); excluded from the shipped-package install per root `SPEC.md`. |

Root `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Liaisons + liaison_tools" bullet (Subsystem Map) states the one-paragraph
version of the composition this document expands: `guest-liaison.md` and `mad-guest-liaison.md`
share these helpers rather than each reimplementing the wire protocol or the messages-file format,
and `relay-driver.py` composes the same two helpers into a separate, scripted loop.

## Wire Transport Internals (`post-openai.py`)

**One opener, redirects refused.** `_OPENER = urllib.request.build_opener(_NoRedirectHandler)` is
the single `urllib` opener every request in the module goes through.
`_NoRedirectHandler.redirect_request` raises `RedirectRefused` unconditionally rather than following
a `3xx` — the mechanism behind SPEC's "redirects are never followed" guarantee, because `urllib`'s
default handler copies request headers, `Authorization` included, to the redirect target.

**Key containment.** `post-openai.py` is the only file in the package that opens the key file,
reading it straight into memory with `Path.read_text`. `msg-util.py` never touches it, and
`relay-driver.py` passes `API_KEY_FILE`'s path through to the transport without reading it. SPEC's
API Key Handling guarantees rest on that confinement: a key read added anywhere else is a second
place the key can leak from.

**SSE demux (`demux_sse`).** Reads a line iterator, ignores blank lines and `:`-prefixed comments,
and only inspects `data:`-prefixed lines. `[DONE]` ends the stream cleanly; a line whose parsed JSON
carries an `error` object is reported to stderr immediately and short-circuits with status 2.
Returns `(chunks, status)` where status is 0 (clean), 1 (no data events at all), 2 (mid-stream
error), or 3 (stream ended without `[DONE]` but had data). `chunk_payloads`, when supplied, collects
each payload string verbatim for `DEBUG_RESPONSE` dumps; `raw_buffer` collects every raw line for
error reporting.

**Reassembly (`reassemble_stream`).** Accumulates `delta.content` strings into one buffer and
`delta.tool_calls` into a dict keyed by the API's own `index`, merging `id`/`type`/`function.name`
(last-non-null wins) and concatenating `function.arguments` fragments in arrival order. If any
tool-call slots were populated, the output is `TOOL_CALLS\n` plus the JSON-serialized ordered list;
otherwise it is the concatenated content text. Its docstring names the bash embedded-python
implementation it ports; this is now the only reassembler in the tree.

**Usage and finish-reason extraction.** `extract_usage` and `extract_finish_reason` both do a
last-object-wins scan over every parsed chunk, which is what lets one function cover both response
shapes without branching: a non-streaming full completion (usage beside `choices` at the top level)
and an SSE stream, where usage typically rides a late chunk with empty `choices` — the shape
`reassemble_stream` itself skips — or the final delta.

**Model-not-found retry.** `is_model_error_text` sniffs a pre-stream HTTP body for a model-error
shape (JSON-aware first: `error.code`/`error.message` or `detail`; falls back to a plain-text
regex). On an exit-1 result whose body matches, `main()` calls `resolve_model` (a `GET /models`
lookup, exact-or-unambiguous-substring match) and retries the whole streaming call once against the
resolved name, emitting warnings either way. This retry is not attempted a second time if it also
fails.

**Exit-code assembly.** `COMPLETE_FINISH_REASONS = {"stop", "tool_calls", "function_call"}` is the
sole table `main()` checks a `finish_reason` against; anything else marks the reply `incomplete`.
The usage side-channel write happens before the incomplete/empty branch is evaluated — deliberately,
per the inline comment, because the call completed and the tokens were spent regardless of the
reply's usability.

## Messages-File Mutator Internals (`msg-util.py`)

**Lock: `flock`, released by the kernel.** `exclusive_lock` opens `<target>.lock` and takes
`fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` in a poll bounded at `LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, holding it for the
whole read-modify-write and releasing it by closing the descriptor in a `finally`. The choice is
about what happens when a mutator *dies*: the operating system drops the lock with the process, so
there is no stale-lock apparatus to carry — no orphan to detect, and no diagnostic asking an
operator to remove something by hand. Three outcomes stay distinguished, which is the part worth
keeping from the shell it replaces: an `os.open` that fails is a missing or unwritable parent
directory and is reported immediately; an `flock` that fails with anything but
`EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`/`EACCES` is a filesystem that cannot lock and is reported immediately; only
genuine contention waits, and only until the timeout. The lock file is created once and never
unlinked — unlinking it would let a waiter hold the lock on an unlinked inode while a newcomer
creates and locks a fresh one, putting two mutators in the same critical section.

**Scratch file placement: `TMPDIR` override.** `scratch_dir` returns `TMPDIR` when the caller set
one, otherwise the messages file's own directory — which is always on the target's filesystem. A
scratch file here carries the *entire* messages array, so routing it through system-wide temp is
both off-limits scratch and typically a different filesystem. `write_messages` closes with
`os.replace`, which refuses a cross-filesystem move outright rather than degrading to the
copy-plus-unlink `mv` would perform — the operation that can leave a full transcript behind when
interrupted. The scratch file is removed in a `finally`, which fires on the error paths and on an
unhandled exception alike (this is the shell EXIT trap's replacement; neither survives `SIGKILL`,
and under `flock` neither needs to).

**One implementation, three modes.** `init`, `append` and `validate` share `read_text`,
`write_messages` and `load_turns`; all JSON goes through `json.load`/`json.dump`, never string
concatenation. Every read and write pins `encoding="utf-8"`, so the three modes cannot disagree
about whether a file is well-formed text (SPEC.md, Encoding).

**Role mapping (`MAP_ROLE`).** `user` → `user`, `agent` → `assistant`; any other value is a hard
error. This is the only place the CLI-facing role name `agent` and the JSON-facing role name
`assistant` are translated — `FILE_ROLES` (`system`, `user`, `assistant`), which `validate` checks
against, never includes `agent`, because `agent` never appears inside the file.

**Hand-rolled argument parsing, deliberately.** The three modes are dispatched and their flags
parsed by hand rather than by `argparse`, because the argv surface is a contract two agent
definitions invoke by command line: `argparse` would accept spellings this tool never did
(space-separated flag values, prefix abbreviations), exit 2 where the contract says 1, and replace
the diagnostics with its own. `UsageError` (reported with the usage block) and `MsgUtilError`
(reported alone) are the two exit paths, and `main` is the only place either becomes an exit status
— which is what makes "a failed write must not exit 0" (`LC-S1`, below) structural rather than a
discipline every branch has to remember.

## `relay-driver.py`: Composition and the Conversation Loop

**Composition, not reimplementation.** `_TOOLS_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent` locates
`msg-util.py` and `post-openai.py` as siblings; every messages-file mutation goes through
`_msg_init`/`_msg_append` (thin `subprocess.run` wrappers around `msg-util.py`), and every model
call goes through `_post`/`_post_with_retries` (wrapping `post-openai.py` by default, with `post_fn`
injectable for tests). The module docstring states this as a contract highlight: `post-openai.py` is
the *only* transport and `msg-util.py` the *only* messages-file mutator this driver uses. The driver
spawns the mutator rather than loading it: one invocation shape for every caller, and the subprocess
boundary is what keeps the driver honest about using the same argv contract the liaison definitions
do.

**One protocol definition, two consumers.** `FINAL_MARKER`, `TOOL_CALLS_MARKER`,
`MIN_REQUEST_LINES`/`MAX_REQUEST_LINES`, and `_REQUEST_VERBS` are the sole source constants;
`REQUEST_LINE_RE` (what `classify()` parses) and `PROTOCOL_BLOCK` (the text shown to the guest
model, appended to the caller's system prompt by `build_system_prompt`) are both derived from them,
so the classifier grammar and the text describing that grammar cannot drift apart by construction.

**Framing corpus content against forgery.** `frame_serviced` wraps every serviced READ/LIST/GREP
result in `SERVICED_OPEN_DELIMITER`/`SERVICED_CLOSE_DELIMITER` lines and neutralizes any literal
occurrence of those delimiter strings *inside* the corpus content itself (replacing `=` with `≡` in
an in-content match), so a corpus file cannot forge a frame boundary and impersonate
liaison-authored text from inside its own content. Everything the driver authors itself (budget
notices, refusals, tool-call stubs) stays outside the frame — that separation is what keeps a
delivered file quoting a liaison notice distinguishable from the real notice.

**Bounding guest-chosen text.** `sanitize_echo` flattens control characters (newlines included) to
spaces and truncates to `MAX_ECHO_CHARS` (200) before any guest-chosen string — a requested path, a
GREP pattern, a tool-call name — is echoed back into driver-authored prose. This is what stops an
attacker-chosen string from spanning lines and forging a plausible-looking liaison sentence around
itself.

**Path confinement (`resolve_corpus_path`).** Resolves the candidate path against the *resolved*
corpus root and requires `relative_to(root)` to succeed — traversal and symlink escapes both
normalize outside the root under this check and are refused identically. A path the OS cannot
resolve at all (embedded NUL, over `PATH_MAX`) is refused the same way, not treated as an exception
to propagate. `service_grep`'s directory walk re-applies this same check per file rather than
trusting `os.walk`'s traversal, because a symlink inside the tree can resolve outside it exactly as
a crafted path argument can — confinement here is per-file, not per-verb.

**The conversation loop (`run_question`).** A `while True:` loop bounded at its top by `round_trips
>= cfg.max_round_trips` — the comment notes this bounds *every* conversation shape, including a
permanently-malformed or TOOL_CALLS-looping guest, neither of which touches the request budget at
all (a gap the prior driver this was promoted from did not close). Within one round: a transport
call (`_post_with_retries`, exponential backoff `RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS * 2**attempt`, retried only
when `is_transport_failure` — excluding the protocol exits 3/4); classification (`final` /
`tool_calls` / `malformed` / `request`); and, on `request`, budget bookkeeping (`budget_used`, a
warn line at `cfg.warn_at` remaining, a forced-final demand after exhaustion capped at
`FORCED_FINAL_ATTEMPTS` = 2 before giving up).

**TOOL_CALLS stub-and-continue.** A `tool_calls` classification is answered with a stub line per
named call (`Tool call <name> is not available in this environment.`) rather than being serviced.
The inline comment marks this as load-bearing, not a placeholder: a guest model fabricated
never-relayed file content after a stubbed tool-call turn in a live run, so the stub text is a
hardening layer against exactly that, not a TODO to "improve away."

**`--env-file` allowlist (`CONNECTION_ENV_KEYS`).** `load_connection_env` parses `KEY=VALUE` lines
and refuses any key outside the closed set (`API_BASE_URL`, `API_KEY_FILE`, `MODEL`, `ALLOW_HTTP`,
`MAX_TOKENS`, `ENABLE_THINKING`, `TEMPERATURE`, `DEBUG_POST`, `DEBUG_RESPONSE`) — the inline comment
states the reason: an env file is exactly the kind of thing that gets pasted around, and without
this list a "connection env file" could set `PATH`/`PYTHONPATH`/`PYTHONSTARTUP` on the very process
that reads the API key.

## Test Layout

| Module | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_post_openai.py` | SSE demux/reassembly and API-key-format validation against `test-fixture-*.txt` fixtures (offline); an end-to-end subprocess class against a stubbed local `http.server` endpoint, proving the stdout contract byte-for-byte in both shapes. Documented gaps: `/models` listing and substring model-resolution retry, and real mid-stream connection drops — `is_model_error_text`, the pure sniffing those paths pivot on, is covered. |
| `test_msg-util.py` | The three properties an adversarial review found missing (module docstring's own naming): `LC-S1` a failed write must not exit 0, `LC-S2` concurrent appends must not lose turns, `LC-S3` scratch must land on the target's filesystem — plus `LC-M3`, the `validate` verb, and a killed lock holder not blocking the next mutation. |
| `test_relay_driver.py` | The reply classifier, path confinement (traversal/absolute/symlink-escape), the protocol-block append contract, the budget state machine, the loop-top round-trip guard, and READ/LIST/GREP servicing against a fixture corpus; an end-to-end subprocess class against a stubbed SSE endpoint proving a full scripted run (answer file, `stats.csv` with real token totals, `messages.json` shape). |

Per-suite case counts are not recorded here — nothing would check them; `just test liaison_tools`
reports the live numbers.

All three suites are stdlib-only and never touch the network beyond `127.0.0.1` (per each module's
own docstring). Run via `just test liaison_tools` (or `just test` for the full tooling suite:
`kb_tools` + `liaison_tools` + `gen_defs`), which sets `PYTHONPATH` to the repository root so the
shipped packages import as top-level packages — the same import shape a consumer gets with
`PYTHONPATH=.claude/agents` after install.

## Caller Composition

| Caller | Tools it invokes | Session layout |
|---|---|---|
| `guest-liaison.md` | `post-openai.py`, `msg-util.py` — invoked directly from the definition body | `guest-session/<topic>/messages.json` + `tmp/` |
| `mad-guest-liaison.md` | `post-openai.py`, `msg-util.py` — invoked directly from the definition body | `liaison-messages.json` + `tmp/` inside the run directory its referee hands it, which differs between a review run and a design run |
| `relay-driver.py` | `post-openai.py` (sole transport), `msg-util.py` (sole messages-file mutator) | its own, under `--output-dir` (SPEC.md, `relay-driver.py`) |

Frontmatter stripping is not a tool here: each liaison definition runs the `sed` range itself. No
layout above is asserted or checked by anything in this package (SPEC.md, Paths).
