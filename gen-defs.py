"""
Generator and consistency checker for the generated definitions in this
repository — agent definitions and slash-command definitions alike.

Templates live in two sibling trees under templates/, and a template's surface
tree routes its output into the matching deployed surface beneath the output
root the invocation names (ROOT below; every verb takes it as its positional
argument, and none of them defaults — this repository keeps no rendered tree
of its own for a render to default into):

    templates/agents/<name>.md.tmpl    + templates/shared-chunks.toml -> ROOT/agents/<name>.md
    templates/commands/<name>.md.tmpl  + templates/shared-chunks.toml -> ROOT/commands/<name>.md

Discovery is RECURSIVE within each surface tree, and a template's path is
MIRRORED into its surface — the relative subpath of the template is the
relative subpath of its output. The filesystem is the whole declaration;
there is no metadata key for placement:

    templates/agents/mad/participant-contract.md.tmpl -> ROOT/agents/mad/participant-contract.md

Every other mechanism — chunks, variants, markers, overlay anchors,
multi-output fences, banners, write safety, numbered backups, and both checks
— applies unchanged at a nested path. Check 2 walks *.md RECURSIVELY under each
checked surface, so a banner stranded at a nested path is caught exactly as a
top-level one is. The surface directories under ROOT, and the mirrored
subdirectories beneath them, are created as needed.

templates/shared-chunks.toml is the single chunk source for both template
types. A template holds everything unique to its definition; every span of
text shared with other definitions is a marker referencing a chunk, so shared
text lives in exactly one place. templates/commands/ may be absent or empty
(git does not track an empty directory); that is not an error so long as at
least one template exists somewhere.

Enrollment is template existence, and nothing else. There is no enrollment
list and no exclusion list: the tool generates every definition its templates
declare and touches no other file. Every path printed and matched below is
derived from this script's own location at the repository root.

One template may render SEVERAL definitions. A template that opens with a
fenced TOML block declares them, along with the parameters that differ:

    +++
    [outputs.mad-participant-opus]
    model = "opus"
    color = "#6D28D9"

    [outputs.mad-participant-haiku]
    model = "haiku"
    color = "#5B21B6"
    +++
    ---
    name: @!arg.name!@
    model: @!arg.model!@
    ---
    <one body, rendered identically into every output>

Each declared key is readable in the body as @!arg.<key>!@, plus @!arg.name!@
bound to the output's own name. The fence is where those values are BOUND, so
its keys are bare; the prefix goes where one is CONSUMED (Marker syntax,
below). Bodies are therefore identical by construction rather than by
maintenance discipline. A template with no such block renders a single
definition named after the template, at the template's mirrored path. Chunks,
variants, markers, wrapping, multi-output declarations, write safety, backups,
and the render-identity check apply identically to both template types.

Usage — no default mode: a verb is required. `just render`, `just install`,
and `just install-claude-md` are the sole general-purpose sanctioned entry
points to this script's verbs, as opposed to the fixed-flag verification
rungs (`just generate-floor`, `just check-floor`, `just generate-stock`,
`just check-stock`) that also reach it under a locked tuning; ARCHITECTURE.md,
Sanctioned Invocation, has the complete list of recipes reaching this
script. They wrap:

    python3 gen-defs.py check R              # check the tree under R
    python3 gen-defs.py generate R           # render templates into R
    python3 gen-defs.py install R            # full-product install into R
    python3 gen-defs.py install-claude-md D  # merge the operator baseline into D

The first three name their output root positionally, and none of them
defaults, because there is no in-repository tree left to default to; the
fourth names the operator's own CLAUDE.md and is described under
"Operator-config integration" below. Each verb declares only the flags it can
act on: what a verb cannot do is unrepresentable on its command line rather
than refused after the fact.

Flags common to generate, check and install:

    --family NAME           the model family whose tuning applies: a bare
                            family name resolved against templates/family/
                            (default: claude), or a path to a family file.
                            Bare MODEL names are not valid values.
    --model-tier-map SPEC   override the tier -> family member map the family
                            declares: comma-separated tier=member pairs, or
                            all=member. Named tiers mask only themselves.
    --model-pin-map SPEC    override the tier -> rendered pin map: same syntax,
                            over DEFAULT_PIN_MAP below. Pin text is always in
                            the claude model namespace.
    --verbose, -v           list every file, not just the exceptions.

`generate` and `check` additionally take:

    --surfaces WHICH        agents | commands | both (default both): which
                            surface to render or check. Cannot be combined
                            with the selection globs below, which imply it.
    --agent-glob PATTERNS   restrict the run to the agents outputs matching
                            PATTERNS: one or more fnmatch patterns joined by
                            "|" ("*app-expert*|*-coder*"). See below.
    --command-glob PATTERNS the same, over the commands surface.

and `check` alone takes:

    --no-diff               report drift without printing the diff.

`install` takes none of those four: it delivers the product entire, and a
partial install is a future feature.

ROOT is asserted to be an existing directory and is otherwise unconstrained —
inside this repository or anywhere else; the surface subdirectories are created
under it as needed. The full per-target safety table below (banner detection,
numbered backups, refusal of bannerless files) applies identically wherever it
lands.

Definition selection — --agent-glob and --command-glob:

A pattern is matched against an output's SURFACE-RELATIVE path with the .md
suffix dropped — go-coder, kb-start, mad/participant-contract — under fnmatch
semantics, in which `*` crosses `/`. A nested output is therefore addressable
both by its full key (mad/participant-contract) and by any pattern spanning
the separator (*participant-contract*), and a bare *-coder* selects the
top-level coders without reaching into a subdirectory only because none of
those outputs live in one.

Presence of either glob IMPLIES the surface(s) the run covers: --agent-glob
alone renders/checks the agents surface only, filtered; --command-glob alone
the commands surface only; both, both surfaces, each filtered by its own
patterns; neither, every output, as always. --surfaces is therefore redundant
with a glob and combining them is an argparse error. Narrowing an install is
not an error but an impossibility: `install` declares neither the globs nor
--surfaces, so an install always delivers the whole product.

Selection filters PER OUTPUT, not per template: a glob matching one output of
a multi-output template renders or checks exactly that one, and the template's
other outputs are left untouched on disk and reported as nothing at all.

A pattern matching zero outputs — any single "|"-segment, and therefore the
set — is a hard error naming the pattern and listing what the surface does
declare. A selection that silently selected nothing would report exactly like
a clean run. What was selected is stated in the run report, per surface:

    agents: 12 of 24 outputs selected by --agent-glob

Selection composes orthogonally with everything else: overlay anchors and tier
resolution, banners and tuning claims, the write-safety table, and both checks
all apply to the selected outputs exactly as they do to a full run.

Tier tokens and the two maps:

A definition declares its capability TIER at its pin site, as one of five
markers in the `dyn.` namespace — the invocation's own parameters:

    model: @!dyn.tier-highest!@ | @!dyn.tier-high!@ | @!dyn.tier-medium!@ |
           @!dyn.tier-low!@     | @!dyn.tier-lowest!@

They are bound at load time to `pin_map[<tier>]`, in a dynamic table threaded
through every expansion, so they expand wherever a marker does — template
bodies, chunk bodies, variants, defaults, and overlay text alike. Nothing is
reserved against the chunk table for them: a [chunks.tier-low] table is an
ordinary chunk, reachable as the bare @!tier-low!@, because the namespace is
what separates the two.

Two independent maps, each TOTAL over the five tiers on every render:

    tier map   tier -> FAMILY MEMBER. Declared by the family file's required
               [tiers] table; --model-tier-map masks the tiers it names. It
               selects whose [family.*.models.<member>] overrides a definition
               is tuned against, and never reaches rendered text.
    pin map    tier -> RENDERED PIN TEXT, always a claude-legal model name.
               Defaults to DEFAULT_PIN_MAP below; --model-pin-map masks the
               tiers it names. It is the SOLE source of the @!dyn.tier-*!@
               tokens.

The two are independent on purpose: what a definition is TUNED for and what it
DISPATCHES on are separately chosen, so their divergence is disclosed rather
than prevented. A tier-map value is NOT validated against the family's overlay
tables — naming a member the family declares no override for is the legal
STOCK state below, never an error. A pin-map value is not validated at all:
nothing in this repository owns the set of legal claude aliases, so the report
echo and the banner are the whole safety story there. That is an accepted risk,
stated so it does not get "fixed" into a gate.

Merge semantics, identical for both flags: start from the defaults; `all=V`
overwrites all five; then each named tier is applied. So `all=haiku,high=opus`
is haiku everywhere but high, whichever order the two appear in, and a named
tier masks ONLY itself — unnamed tiers keep their default. A key that is
neither one of the five tiers nor `all`, a duplicate key, and a malformed pair
are each hard errors. Both merged maps are total by construction: a tier
holding no member, or no pin, is unrepresentable rather than an error branch.

Per-output tier discovery renders a template's body TWICE. The first pass binds
the tier tokens to a marker-free sentinel (`tier:high`), so reading the pin out
of that render's frontmatter yields the output's own tier; the second renders
for real, under the overlay set that tier resolves. The second pass is
UNCONDITIONAL — a tier token in a body or a chunk would otherwise ship sentinel
text into a system prompt. An output with no pin site at all (the participant
contract, the generated commands) declares no tier and takes family-wide
overlay text only.

A pin site that resolves NO tier — a literal `model: opus` where a token
belongs — is a hard error naming the output and its pin. It is the one failure
the render path cannot afford to tolerate quietly: a literal pin renders the
same bytes as the token that replaced it and silently loses the definition's
model scope, so a template landing with one would be tuned against nothing and
nothing would say so.

Model tuning — overlay anchors and family files:

    @!fam.<key>!@

is a marker usable in template bodies and chunk bodies: text layered over base
text, present or absent depending on which source file is loaded. `fam` is an
OVERLAY NAMESPACE — a prefix naming the source that fills the anchor, filled by
a family file's [family.<key>] tables, and the only one registered
(OVERLAY_NAMESPACES). Registering a second — a harness file, say — is a name in
that tuple plus the loader that reads it; resolution keys on the marker's full
spelling, so nothing downstream learns the new name. A marker whose namespace
is not registered is a hard error wherever it is read: an anchor no loaded
source fills renders as NOTHING by design, so a typo'd namespace has no other
way to announce itself.

With a loaded family file carrying no entry for an anchor, it expands to
nothing at all — a base render is byte-identical whether or not the anchor
exists. A family file (templates/family/<family>.toml) declares its tier map
and fills `fam.*` anchors:

    [tiers]
    highest = "fable"                     # all five tiers, or the file does
    high    = "opus"                      # not load — see below
    medium  = "sonnet"
    low     = "haiku"
    lowest  = "haiku"

    [family.<key>]
    text = "..."                          # fills fam.<key> family-wide

    [family.<key>.models.<member>]
    text = "..."                          # overrides the family text for that
                                          # family member

The table's key IS the anchor key: [family.gap-aversion] fills
@!fam.gap-aversion!@. The table name stays `family` — it is where the text is
AUTHORED, and SPEC.md names it — while `fam` is the namespace a template
CONSUMES it through.

Resolution, not accumulation: AT MOST ONE overlay renders per anchor — the
model scope wins over the family scope.

Family selection — what one --family NAME means:

    1. path-shaped   — contains a path separator or ends in .toml: taken as a
                       path to a family file, unresolved and unvalidated here
                       (load_family owns the existence error).
    2. family name   — <NAME>.toml under templates/family/.

Anything else is an error listing the available families. A bare MODEL name is
not a family name, and there is no third resolution step behind it.

The [tiers] table is REQUIRED and TOTAL. A family file that omits it, drops a
tier, or names a key outside the five fails to LOAD rather than falling back to
a partial map, to another family's members, or to the pin map: there is no
fallback anywhere in this resolution, and the default FAMILY is a selection,
not a fallback value. A family file may still carry zero [family.*] tables — a
family name is reservable before an observed failure motivates an entry — but
it needs its five-line [tiers] table to do so.

Two render states, plus one config error:

    Tuned    the tier's member has [family.<key>.models.<member>] tables: model
             scope wins over family-wide scope, per anchor. Named once per run,
             in the run's one notice about member scope.
    Stock    the tier's member has ZERO such tables anywhere in the family.
             Legal and unreported — silence is the stock state — and recorded
             in the banner's `stock=` field. A member with a table for one
             anchor and not another is NOT stock — that anchor simply falls
             back to family-wide text.
    (error)  [tiers] absent, incomplete, or carrying an unknown key.

A member named by a [family.*.models.<member>] table that no tier reaches — in
neither the family's own [tiers] nor the effective tier map — is a hard error:
the table could never render, which is exactly the class
validate_family_anchors already rejects for anchor names. Checking the UNION is
what lets a table be authored for a member reachable only via
--model-tier-map without failing a default run.

Family scope is unchanged by any of that: a loaded family file's family-wide
text fills its anchors render-wide, for outputs with a tier and outputs with no
pin site alike. Only MODEL-scoped entries require a tier. The banner records
the invocation's whole triple, and tier resolution is a deterministic function
of that triple and the templates, so check reproduces it exactly.

A filled anchor renders its family text VERBATIM in place — no lead-in, no
wrapper, no marker of its own around it, so a family file can restore a passage
of contract prose as readily as it can add a corrective note; an author wanting
a lead-in writes one into their text. Neither the family nor the member name
appears in rendered output — the family file is the provenance record. The
filled text is itself marker-expanded, so a typo'd chunk reference inside it
fails loudly. A family-file entry naming an anchor that exists in no template
or chunk is a hard error, and a family declaring anchors reports which of them
were filled and from which scope (family vs model). NO name is reserved
anywhere in this: the namespace is what separates an anchor from a chunk, so
`overlay` and `tier-low` are ordinary chunk names now.

Structural invariant: a family file can never replace, suppress, or modify
BASE text — it can only fill anchors that base templates and chunks
deliberately expose. Anchors are authored on demand, when an observed failure
motivates one; they are never pre-sprinkled speculatively. See
templates/family/README.md and README.md ("Variants and platform
compatibility") for the provenance discipline.

Per-target safety — a target is only ever written when it is provably ours,
and an overwrite never destroys content this tool did not itself write:

    target missing                  -> created
    banner, render identical        -> no write at all (counted as unchanged)
    banner, body hash matches the
      banner's claim, render differs-> overwritten in place, NO backup: the
                                       prior content is provably this tool's
                                       own output, reproducible from the
                                       template, so a copy of it is landfill
    banner, body hash absent or
      mismatched, render differs    -> hand-edited (or pre-hash) content:
                                       copied to <name>.md.<NN>.bak, then
                                       written in place
    target exists without a banner  -> REFUSED, never written, reported, nonzero

The hash-verified branch is what keeps routine regeneration — and an install's
render pass over a freshly copied tree — from churning out backups
nobody reads. A backup sits beside the file it backs up —
agents/go-coder.md.00.bak next to agents/go-coder.md — and the repo's root
*.bak gitignore rule keeps it out of git. Serials are per-target, zero-padded
from 00, allocated as the highest existing serial plus one, and never reused.

Every write in this tool is a CONTENT write and nothing else. An extant target
is written in place — its inode, owner and mode survive untouched — and a
backup is a plain content copy into a new file the tool itself owns, never a
metadata clone of the file it copies. That is a portability property, not a
detail: writing bytes into an existing file needs only write permission, while
cloning mtime or mode (utime, chmod — what shutil.copy2/copystat/copymode do)
requires OWNERSHIP of the target, which fails outright in a shared group-writable
tree whose files another user installed. Timestamps carry no meaning anywhere in
this system — integrity is decided by the banner's content hash — so cloned
metadata bought nothing and cost a mid-run EACCES that could split an install
into a partial apply. The one metadata write left is on the creation path
alone: a file the tool has just created takes the source's executable bit (a
chmod on a file it owns by construction, always legal), so an installed shell
tool stays runnable.

There is no wrong-output-directory-constant guard, because there is no
constant: every run names its ROOT, ROOT is asserted to exist, and the report
states where the files landed. The surface directories under ROOT and the
mirrored subdirectories beneath them come from the template tree rather than
from a constant, and are created as needed.

Full-product install — `install ROOT`:

    python3 gen-defs.py install <project>/.claude [--family NAME]
        [--model-tier-map SPEC] [--model-pin-map SPEC]

An install delivers the whole deployed product in two halves. The shipped
packages (kb_tools/, liaison_tools/) are a REMOVE-AND-RECURSIVE-COPY
into the destinations the table below names, minus one explicit exclusion list
(INSTALL_EXCLUDED_*) — test suites and their fixtures, python/pytest caches,
*.bak safety copies, .DS_Store, and this repository's own project
documentation, which is code's provenance rather than part of it. There is no
inclusion list and no complement computation: a new tool file ships with no
enrollment step. The definitions are RENDERED into ROOT's two surfaces by the
ordinary generation pass — there is no checked-in render to copy, so the copy
half never had them to deliver, and the (family, tier-map, pin-map) triple an
install was given is just the triple that render runs under. `install` declares
neither `--surfaces` nor the selection globs, which would narrow the product to
a partial install.

Where a copied file LANDS is not, however, read off where its source sits. The
shipped code packages travel by an explicit source -> destination table
(SHIPPED_PACKAGES): each row pairs a source directory in this repository with
the ROOT-relative destination it must arrive at, and the copy walks the row's
source while keying every file to the row's destination. The destination is a
CONSUMER contract — runner snippets already installed in consuming projects
name .claude/agents/kb_tools/..., and every definition body writes its paths
against .claude/agents/... — so the source may be relocated within this
repository and the destination may not follow it. Stating the pairing as data
is what keeps those two facts independent; deriving the destination from
directory placement is what made them the same fact.

EVERY install renders, whatever triple it was given: a default-triple install
is one triple among the possible ones, not a special case with a copy behind
it, which is what makes a default install and a tuned one the same code path
and the same guarantee. The render pass receives the effective triple and the
tier resolver the invocation built, so an install can never deliver
definitions tuned differently from what its own banners claim. Every target
that pass meets is absent or provably untouched tool output (see the
banner's body hash below), so it leaves no numbered backups behind. Only a
NON-DEFAULT triple earns a clause on the summary line — a default render is
the non-event report-by-exception exists for.

The installed tree is an ARTIFACT, not a working copy: this repository is the
source of truth and a re-install always overwrites. Local edits to installed
files are never preserved — edit the templates or the definitions here and
re-install — but they are not destroyed either: a target that is not provably
this tool's own output is copied aside as a numbered .bak first, exactly as
generation does it. The overwrite always happens; the backup only keeps
divergent human work from being destroyed by it, and *.bak files under an
installed tree are deletable at will.

A shipped package's destination is the one place that does not hold, and the
difference is of unit rather than of degree. The directory is this
repository's entire — its contents are ours and none of it is a consuming
project's to maintain — so an install REMOVES IT WHOLE and writes the package
fresh rather than reconciling it file by file. That is what retires a file
whose source here has since been deleted, by construction instead of by
detection: the copy writes what the package holds now and has no way to notice
what it used to hold. Nothing inside one is set aside first, so a local edit
made there is gone at the next install rather than preserved beside itself.
Two rules at two granularities, and the boundary between them is the one the
SHIPPED_PACKAGES table already draws: per-file and banner-gated out on the
deployed surfaces, where a consuming project's own files legitimately sit;
wholesale inside a package destination, where they do not.

Last, an install PRUNES (prune_stale). Overwriting is only half of keeping an
artifact tree true to its source: a definition whose template has since been
deleted is written by nothing and so survives every re-install, drifting there
forever — reported ORPHAN by check, and carried by a diff between two render
slots as a permanent `Only in` line. So a file under a deployed surface that
this run did NOT write, that carries one of this tool's banners, and whose
body still hashes to that banner's claim is DELETED, together with any
directory the deletion empties. The two complements are the point of the rule
and not exceptions to it: a banner whose hash does not match is hand-edited and
is never deleted (that is the .bak branch's territory and it stays there), and
a file carrying no banner of ours is not ours at all — a consuming project's
.claude/ holds other people's files. The shipped packages' destinations are
outside the sweep entirely, and need nothing from it: the copy half replaced
each of them whole. The prune runs AFTER both halves have written, so
the write set is a fact on disk rather than a prediction and a run that failed
mid-render leaves one stale file too many rather than one live definition too
few. Every path it deletes is named in the report, --verbose or not.

An install writes exactly as generation does (see the content-write paragraph
above): an extant definition under a deployed surface is rewritten through its
own inode, so a tree installed by one user updates cleanly under another so
long as the group can write. Ownership and mode are whatever the first install
left. A COPIED file is always a fresh one — its destination went with the
directory — and is chmodded only to carry the source's executable bit.

Every COPIED file is stamped with an !INSTALLED! banner carrying the same
!BODY-SHA256! line the generated banner carries, in whatever comment syntax
its filetype admits:

    *.md with frontmatter    comment lines inside the frontmatter block —
                             dropped by every frontmatter reader, the body
                             extraction the liaisons run included
    *.md without, commands/  a minimal frontmatter block holding only the
                             banner, as render_template already does for a
                             frontmatter-less command template: a command's
                             first BODY line is the description Claude Code
                             lists it by, and nothing may displace it
    *.md without, agents/    an HTML comment block above the content — a
                             shipped package's own documentation must not gain
                             frontmatter, which would present it as a
                             definition
    .py .sh .toml .mk .just  `#` comment lines at the top, below a shebang
    any other suffix         no comment syntax to carry a banner: the file is
                             copied verbatim, and --verbose names it (which
                             files those are follows from their suffix alone,
                             so a clean install does not report it)

Third-party source vendored into a shipped package under a `_vendor/`
directory is exempt whatever its suffix: the banner would assert adjagent
provenance over code we did not write, and tell its reader to edit a source
repository that is not the file's. It is copied verbatim and --verbose names
it as unstamped. A STAMPING carve-out only — vendored code ships like any
other package file, and the exclusion list above is untouched.

A generated definition is exempt: it arrives carrying its own !GENERATED!
banner, which already forbids in-place edits and names the real edit path.
The two banners are one marking scheme — provenance plus a body hash — and
the hash buys the same thing on re-install that it buys on regeneration: a
target whose body still hashes to its own banner is provably ours and is
overwritten silently, while a mismatched or unbannered target is backed up
first. Re-installing an untouched tree is therefore byte-stable: no content
changes and no backups.

The banner is a five-line YAML-comment block naming the source template
(`# !GENERATED! from templates/agents/<name>.md.tmpl ...`) above a `!TUNING!`
line and the body hash:

    #
    # !GENERATED! from <tmpl> and <chunks> — edit those. DO NOT HAND EDIT ...
    # !TUNING! family=<file> seat=<tier|none> member=<member|none>
              tier=<tier map> pin=<pin map> stock=<tiers|none>
    # !BODY-SHA256! <hex>
    #

(one physical line for `!TUNING!`; wrapped here only to fit). `family=` and
the two maps are the render's whole triple, both maps EFFECTIVE — post-merge —
and serialized in TIERS order rather than sorted, so the claim is deterministic
and reads highest-to-lowest. `seat=` and `member=` are this definition's OWN
resolution: the tier its pin site declared and the family member its overlays
resolved against, `none` for an output with no pin site. They are carried
because the pin map is not injective (`low` and `lowest` both default to
haiku), so a definition's tier cannot be recovered by inverting it — recording
the answer is what keeps a definition's tuning readable from the definition
alone. `member=` is redundant with tier[seat] in a well-formed banner, and that
is the point: it is the cheap cross-check catching a banner written under one
tier map and read under another. `stock=` lists the tiers whose mapped member
declares zero [family.*.models.<member>] tables in the loaded family, or `none`.
The banner always lives inside YAML frontmatter, never in the body that becomes
a prompt:

  - An agent template must open with a frontmatter block; the banner is
    injected at its top.
  - A command template whose body opens with a frontmatter block gets the
    banner injected the same way; a command template with no frontmatter gets
    a minimal frontmatter block emitted above its body, containing only the
    banner comment lines, so the banner never lands in the literal prompt
    text.

Its `# !BODY-SHA256! <hex>` line is the sha256 of everything the file
holds AFTER the banner block, exactly as written — the one line both banner
kinds share. It lets any later reader answer a question the banner alone
cannot: is this file still the bytes the tool wrote, or has someone edited it
since? A file whose body hashes to its own claim is provably untouched tool
output — reproducible at will, and therefore safe to overwrite without a
backup (see the safety table above). A pre-1.5.0 banner carries no hash line
and proves nothing, so it is treated as possibly hand-edited.

A definition without a banner is presumed hand-maintained and outside this
tool's remit; if it should be generated, delete it and re-run.

Operator-config integration — `install-claude-md DEST`:

    python3 gen-defs.py install-claude-md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
        [--source user-config/INSTALLED_CLAUDE.md]

DEST is a file its operator owns and edits, so this verb MERGES rather than
overwrites, and it never marks the file it writes: CLAUDE.md has no comment
syntax a reading model would not also read, so a region marker would ship into
every session that loads it. Nothing is stored beside the live file either —
the merge base is recovered from git.

The base is the published revision the operator most likely last integrated:
`git log --follow` over the published baseline (the path has been renamed, and
a revision from before the rename is exactly the era a live file may date
from), each revision diffed against the live file, and the candidates ordered
by how many lines differ. The MERGE VALIDATES THE PICK — a base that produces a
clean whole-block merge corroborates itself, and one that conflicts sends the
next candidate forward — so a near-miss in the ordering costs a retry rather
than a wrong merge. A revision equal to the published text is not a candidate:
one side of that merge has no changes at all, so it succeeds against anything
and yields the live file unchanged — an update deciding by itself that it had
nothing to deliver.

A MERGE NEVER INSERTS WHAT IS ALREADY THERE: an insertion whose paragraphs
already sit where it would land says the same thing twice, so it is dropped and
the copy in place — the operator's own bytes — is the one that survives. That is
what makes a second run over a file the first one merged a no-op. The base still
on offer then predates the update the live file now carries, and against it the
operator's edit and the applied insertion beside it read as one changed span, so
the insertion is no longer recognisable as already present by position alone.

Four cases, classified and REPORTED before anything is written:

    no shared        the live file was hand-written and never integrated from
    ancestry         ours: there is nothing to align, so everything below our
                     H1 is APPENDED to theirs and the report says to hand-edit
                     out the duplication and whatever contradicts.
    exact match      the live file IS some published revision, so it carries no
                     local edits and the update applies whole. (A live file
                     matching the CURRENT baseline is the no-op.)
    a clear base     merged. Both sides' changes are taken at PARAGRAPH
    plus local       granularity — a paragraph being a run of non-blank lines —
    edits            so every hunk is bounded by blank lines and adds, drops or
                     replaces whole blocks rather than editing inside one. Two
                     sides changing one paragraph differently is a conflict,
                     and a conflict is the next case.
    anything else    BAIL. The baseline is written beside the live file as
                     incoming.CLAUDE.md — extension LAST, so an editor still
                     reads it as Markdown — and nothing else is touched: no
                     partial merge, no backup, no write to the live file. The
                     exit is nonzero, because the integration did not happen.

WRITE AUTHORITY ENDS AT THE SEAM, and that is what the paragraph unit carries
bytes for. Content this verb did not merge into comes back byte-identical —
their paragraphs, their separators, their whitespace-only lines, their doubled
blanks — because a block is emitted from the document it came from rather than
reconstituted from its text, and an untouched region is copied out of the
operator's file rather than out of the base. Normalizing is right in exactly
two places: the published baseline, which this repository authors, and the
joint where our content meets theirs, where a missing blank line is topped up
and nothing already written is trimmed. A tool that tidies a config it was
asked only to update is a tool people stop trusting.

The report is SECTION-granular rather than a diff: which `##` sections the
update adds, which exist in both and differ, which are the operator's own, and
which already match, each as a list of names, under the base revision and its
date. A line diff is the classification's own evidence, not its output —
nobody hand-integrates from a unified diff.

One rolling backup, not the old recipe's numbered `.bak` files. A write that
changes the live file's bytes — the whole-update, unrelated-append, and merge
cases alike — copies what the file held before the write to a single
`backup.CLAUDE.md` beside it: extension last, the same shape as
`incoming.CLAUDE.md`, so an editor still reads it as Markdown. It is
overwritten on the next such write and left alone by one that changes nothing
— the exact-match no-op keeps none because there is none to keep, and the bail
path never touches the live file at all. The numbered `.bak` files the old
recipe left behind accumulated in a directory the operator owns and bought
nothing; a single rolling file that only appears when there is something to
recover is the fix, not a return to it.

`check` runs two checks, each failing nonzero:

  1. Render-identity: every target is byte-identical to its rendered template
     (REFUSED targets are reported as such instead — they are not compared,
     and never written). This catches hand-edits to generated output and
     definitions left stale by a chunk or template change. The reported DIFF
     is taken over the post-banner bytes, so a body change reads as itself
     rather than as a body change plus a churned hash line.
  2. Banner-claims-vs-templates: every *.md anywhere under the checked output
     surfaces carrying a banner has the template that banner names, and that
     template declares it (ORPHAN / MISLABELED otherwise). Check 1 walks
     templates and so is blind to a definition claiming generation with no
     template behind it; this walks the claims back the other way.

Check takes the same ROOT and the same --surfaces / --family /
--model-tier-map / --model-pin-map flags as generate, so a tuned out-of-repo
set gets the identical render-identity and banner-claims validation. The
tuning claim is part of both
checks: check runs under exactly one triple (the one it was invoked with),
renders with it, and requires every target's !TUNING! line to match the one its
own render produces — `seat=` and `member=` included. A target whose recorded
family, either map, seat or member differs is reported MISTUNED naming both
sides, instead of an opaque byte diff; a target whose tuning claim matches but
whose bytes differ is ordinary DRIFT. Validating a tuned set therefore means
invoking check with that set's ROOT and its tuning flags; checking the same
directory under a different triple is expected to fail — that is the mismatch
the banner exists to catch.

Generation is deterministic and idempotent: output depends only on the
template, the shared chunks, and the template's path.

Marker syntax — usable in templates and inside chunk bodies.

A MARKER'S NAMESPACE NAMES THE SOURCE ITS VALUE COMES FROM, and a marker
without one is a chunk. Four sources, four spellings, no precedence between
them: render dispatches on the prefix alone, so a chunk and an argument
sharing a name are two different markers rather than a collision some rule has
to arbitrate.

    @!name!@                     expand chunk "name" — ALWAYS a chunk, and
                                 nothing else
    @!name variant="platform"!@  expand that variant of a multi-variant chunk
    @!name key="value"!@         bind @!arg.key!@ inside the chunk body
    @!name wrap="70"!@           greedy-wrap the expansion to 70 columns
    @!arg.key!@                  the value the call site bound for `key`, or
                                 [chunks.<name>.defaults] where it omitted one
    @!dyn.tier-high!@ …          an invocation parameter — the five tier
                                 tokens, from the PIN map alone (Tier tokens,
                                 above)
    @!fam.gap-aversion!@         model-tuning overlay anchor — expands to
                                 nothing unless the loaded family fills it
                                 (Model tuning, above)

THE PREFIX GOES WHERE A VALUE IS CONSUMED, NEVER WHERE IT IS BOUND. A chunk
marker's `key="value"` argument, a [chunks.<name>.defaults] key, and an
[outputs.<name>] fence key all stay bare: position already says what they are.
It is the marker READING one, inside a body, that carries `arg.`, because
nothing there would otherwise say where the value comes from.

"variant" and "wrap" are reserved argument keys; any other key binds a value
the chunk body reads as @!arg.<key>!@, defaulting to [chunks.<name>.defaults]
when the marker omits it. Argument values cannot contain a double quote. Only
a bare marker takes arguments at all. An unknown chunk name, an unbound
argument, an unknown invocation parameter, and an unregistered namespace are
each errors, so a typo fails loudly rather than shipping into a system prompt
— while an anchor whose namespace IS registered and whose key no loaded source
fills is silence by design, which is exactly why the namespace itself is
policed.

A marker name, a namespace, a family anchor key, and an argument key are one
identifier class — a kebab-case identifier, IDENTIFIER below — built once and
shared by every regex site so they cannot spell it differently and drift apart.
The `.` joining a namespace to a name is deliberately outside that class: it is
the whole of what keeps a namespace from ever being read as a name. A malformed
name fails loudly: `@!write-op-!@` raises "unknown chunk 'write-op-'", naming
the exact string. A malformed argument key, or a malformed namespaced marker
(`@!fam.Gap!@`, `@!fam.a.b!@`), does not parse as a marker at all and ships as
literal text, which the residual-marker guard below refuses at generation
rather than letting it work by accident.

    removes wholesale (replace_package_destinations) can reach one, because a
    destination is always ROOT/agents/<package> and nothing puts that over a
    source sitting at this repository's top level. What both prevent is the
    product materializing inside its own source.

    **ROOT is this repository's root.** `agents/` and `commands/` are names in
    the install product, not directories this repository keeps (SPEC.md,
    Deployed Surfaces), so the render lands as an untracked copy of every
    definition beside the templates that produced it, matched by no `.gitignore`
    entry. The producers are the invocations that resolve ROOT to the repository
    exactly: `just install . --subdir=`, and `just render <slug>` given a slug
    that climbs out of `rendered/`.

    **ROOT is inside a package source.** `just install kb_tools` alone does it,
    ROOT being `kb_tools/.claude`. The first run merely writes the product into
    the source tree; the damage lands on the NEXT one, when those files are
    inside the tree package_pairs walks, so the copy set names sources that the
    destination removal then deletes underneath it and the install aborts
    partway through the copy on a file it had just enumerated. Containment is
    the right test here and equality is not: every directory under a package
    source is as fatal as the source itself. The sources are read from
    SHIPPED_PACKAGES rather than assumed to sit under a deployed surface — a
    package source outside every surface is still a source this install reads.

    The first test is equality and NOT containment, because the sanctioned
    deployment layout is a clone at `<project>/.claude/adjagent/` used as the
    install source: `just install <project>` then resolves ROOT to
    `<project>/.claude`, which contains every package source by construction. A
    containment test there refuses the one workflow this repository exists to
    serve. Equality separates them because the intended layout never makes ROOT
    the repository — it makes ROOT a directory the repository sits under.

    The cost of that narrowing, taken deliberately: a ROOT above the repository
    (`just install .. --subdir=`) is now allowed, and it is allowed because it
    is indistinguishable from the sanctioned layout. It lands an untracked
    render outside this repository rather than inside it, which is a mess in
    somebody else's directory and not a commit risk here.

    Both paths are resolved before comparison, so a symlink or a `..` segment
    cannot route around either test.

    Two halves and a sweep, in order. First a recursive copy of everything package_pairs
    names under `source_root` — the shipped packages, at their frozen
    destinations — minus the exclusion list, with an !INSTALLED!
    banner stamped into every copied file whose type admits one and whose
    provenance is this repository's (so never under `_vendor/`). Each package's
    destination directory is removed entire before that copy begins
    (replace_package_destinations): the directory is this repository's whole,
    so it is replaced as a unit rather than reconciled file by file, and a file
    whose source here was deleted is retired by construction instead of
    surviving in a consumer's tree forever. Nothing inside one is set aside
    first. Then the
    ordinary generation pass, which renders the definitions into the surfaces
    under `root`.

    The definitions are rendered, never copied: this repository keeps no
    checked-in render for a copy to read. The (family, tier-map, pin-map)
    triple the install was given is simply the triple that render runs under,
    which is why a default install and a tuned one are one code path rather
    than a copy and a special case. Every target the pass meets is absent or
    provably untouched output, so it leaves no backups behind.

    Then the stale-output prune (prune_stale), which deletes what the two
    halves did NOT write and this repository can prove it wrote earlier —
    yesterday's definition whose template has since been deleted. Nothing else:
    a hand-edited file and a file with no banner of ours are both left where
    they are.

    Reports by exception. A clean install is one summary line and nothing else:
    what landed where. The lines beyond it are problems only, and each names
    its files — today, a pass that came back unclean, and what the prune did.
    No copied file can contribute one: each lands in a destination this run
    emptied first, so there is no extant content to be set aside and no .bak a
    copy can produce. --verbose still lists every file and names the two
    verbatim populations apart: the unbannered ones, whose filetype (never
    their state) is the whole of what makes them so, and the vendored ones
    under `_vendor/`, which a banner would misattribute to this repository.
    The prune reports the same
    way and is never silent when it acts: deleting a file in a tree the operator
    owns is a problem-class event by definition, so every pruned path is named
    whether or not --verbose asked, and so is every file kept back from the
    prune because its content is not ours.

    The copy finishes before the render begins, so a render that raises leaves
    the packages complete and the definitions partial under ROOT. What landed
    is printed on the way out too — an operator shown only the error would read
    it as "nothing happened."

    A replaced package directory is named on the summary line rather than in a
    block of its own. It is the ordinary path — every install that finds one
    replaces it — so a block would fire on every run and report-by-exception
    would mean nothing; but it is still a directory whose contents went,
    operator edits included, so it is never unnamed either.

    units adds, drops or replaces whole blocks and can never edit inside one.

    document's leading ones — because those bytes are the operator's too, and a
    block copied through a merge has to bring its spacing with it. A document
