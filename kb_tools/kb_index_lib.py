Pure-function parsing and record building for the ``<kb-root>/.index/*.jsonl``

canonical parser for
KB frontmatter, claim-quality entries, and leaf metadata; downstream tools

    * **wrapped** — ``claims: [clm-aaaaaa,`` / ``          clm-bbbbbb]``. The
      opening line does not end in ``]``, so the value falls through to the
      string branch, and every consumer that iterates it (``tuple(fm["claims"])``
      at the leaf-index builder, the subtree union, the orphan-ref check) gets
      one "claim id" per CHARACTER.
    * **YAML-block** — ``claims:`` / ``  - clm-aaaaaa`` / ``  - clm-bbbbbb``.
      The value is empty and the bullet lines carry no colon, so they are
      skipped entirely and the field reads as the empty list — a leaf's whole
      claim set dropped with no diagnostic anywhere.

    Continuation lines are joined into the logical value before it is typed, so
    all three shapes yield the same ``list[str]``.

    object, not a second reader of the block delimiter. What differs is the cost
    of the case where the answer is "none".

    ``FRONTMATTER_RE``'s body is a lazy ``(.*?)`` under ``DOTALL``, so at every

    its closer — but ``parse_frontmatter`` runs over every file in the KB, so
    the shape only has to arrive once.

    The one-pass form rests on a property of the pattern rather than on a
    rewrite of it: **if the FIRST opener has no closer after it, no later opener
    has one either.** Closer positions only increase, and the lazy body spans
    anything, so any closer that a later opener could reach is also reachable

def compute_solidity_full(claim_entries, experiments=(), supports=(), works=()) -> dict[str, SolidityResult]:
    """Compute derivation / experimental / final solidity for every claim.

    THE definitive solidity rule — this docstring and the code below it are the
    statement of it, with no prose second view anywhere. Includes the
    DERIVATION-branch lift from support nodes. One result per
    claim with a numeric ``confidence`` OR a non-pending lift source (a run
    experiment, or a support edge with a non-pending ``sup_solidity``). A claim
    with none is fully pending and omitted (treat absence as ``*pending*``).

    Algorithm:

    * **experimental_solidity[C]** = ``max`` of ``edge.strength`` over all
      ``relation:"strengthens"`` run-experiment edges into ``C``; ``None`` if
      none. Unrun experiments contribute nothing. The MAX/experimental branch.
    * **sup_solidity[S]** (computed in unified topo order — see below) =
      ``round2(min(quality, *S's dep finals))``; pending propagates. Each
      support feeds the DERIVATION branch of its beneficiaries, never the
      experimental/max branch.
    * **local_quality[C]** = ``max(confidence[C], max over supporting sups S of
      sup_solidity[S] × f)``, where a pending ``sup_solidity`` OR a pending
      on-point fraction ``f`` (``PENDING_FRACTION``) is EXCLUDED from the max (no
      NaN, no poison). A support lift never drags a beneficiary with
      otherwise-valid quality to pending — pending flows ONLY from a claim's own
      load-bearing ``depends-on``. NOTE: the support on-point fraction ``f`` is a
      single edge-weight relevance discount (``sup_solidity × f``), NOT a chain,
      so it stays multiplicative — it is not subject to the granularity argument
      that motivates the min dep-gating below.
    * **derivation_solidity[C]** = ``round2(min(local_quality[C], *C's claim-dep
      finals, *C's work-gate strengths))`` — the weakest link in C's dependency
      cone, framework deps 1.0;
      ``None`` if ``local_quality`` is pending (confidence pending AND no support
      lift) OR any claim-dep's final is pending. So a support lift is still
      dep-gated — it does NOT bypass C's own deps the way an experiment's
      max-branch does. The dep-gate is a pure ``min`` (weakest link), not a
      product: solidity is refactor-invariant — splitting one derivation step
      into two same-quality steps must not lower it, and a deep clean chain must
      not decay toward 0 as a bookkeeping artifact (ordinal grades are not
      independent probabilities to be multiplied).
    * **final[C]** = ``max`` over the non-None of ``{derivation, experimental}``;
      ``None`` iff both are None.

    The traversal is :func:`_dependency_order`'s, over **every** claim and
    support: a claim/support is processed after every claim it depends on (so
    dep finals are known) and a claim after every support that supports it (so
    the lift is known), and a cycle anywhere in that graph raises
    :class:`SolidityCycleError` before a single value is computed. Which claims
    carry a value is decided here, afterwards, and decides nothing about which
    graphs raise. Experiments are terminal and introduce no cycles.

    **A ``rests-on`` edge joins the same ``min``, with the pairing's
    applicability deciding membership and the work's ``strength`` deciding the
    gate.** For each ``relation == "rests-on"`` edge out of claim ``C``:

    * ``fraction == 0.0`` — the work bears nothing on this claim, so the pairing
      gates nothing and is skipped before ``strength`` is even read.
    * ``fraction`` numeric and ``> 0`` — the target work's hand-authored
      ``strength`` enters ``C``'s dep-gate ``min`` exactly as a claim dep's final
      does. ``strength 0.0`` therefore gates ``C`` to ``0.0``: citing work judged
      spurious must be able to hurt.
    * ``fraction`` pending (``PENDING_FRACTION``) or absent (``None``), or the
      work's ``strength`` pending / the work absent from ``works`` — ``C``'s
      derivation is pending, poisoning exactly as a pending ``depends`` target
      does. Pending is the safe direction: a claim resting on unjudged outside
      work genuinely has unknown solidity.

    ``fraction`` is read BEFORE ``strength`` and compared explicitly: ``None``,
    ``PENDING_FRACTION`` and ``0.0`` are three distinct states that a falsiness
    test would collapse into one wrong answer. The gate is *membership times
    threshold*, never ``strength × fraction`` — that product runs the wrong way
    under a ``min`` (it makes the gate harsher as applicability falls, so a work
    judged sound-but-irrelevant would annihilate the claim), and any arithmetic
    that discounts toward 1.0 instead both treats ordinal bands as probabilities
    and produces a ``min`` operand written on no disk anywhere. The consequence
    accepted: applicability ``0.3`` and ``1.0`` gate identically.

    A work absent from ``works`` and a work present with ``strength is None``
    differ in intent and not in outcome — both are pending. This computation
    does NOT raise on the dangling target: ``refresh`` runs it before
    :func:`_assert_work_node_coverage`, which is the check that names that
    defect.

    With ``supports=()`` this reduces exactly to the prior behavior:
    ``local_quality[C] == confidence[C]`` and the support machinery is inert.
    With ``works=()`` every ``rests-on`` edge is pending-by-absent-strength,
    which is what a caller holding no register — ``attribute.check_acyclic``,
    walking synthetic claim-to-claim entries — needs and gets.

    Backward-compatible thin wrapper over :func:`compute_solidity_full`:
    returns ``{claim_id: final_solidity}`` for every claim whose final solidity
    is non-pending (numeric). A claim with a pending final (``*pending*``) is
    OMITTED from the mapping — every consumer treats "absent" identically to
    "pending". With zero experiments, ``final == derivation`` for every claim,
    so this returns exactly the historical min-branch result.

    ``solidity = round_half_up_2dp(min(confidence, *dependency solidities))``,
    computed bottom-up over the claim depends-on DAG (Kahn topological sort):

    * A claim's dependencies are its ``depends-on`` edges. A ``claim``-target
      edge contributes that dependency's already-computed (and already-rounded)
      solidity; an ``invariant`` / ``axiom`` edge contributes ``1.0``
      (framework bedrock — solidity-1.0 by definition, never lowers the min).
    * A claim with no depends-on edges has ``solidity = confidence``.
    * The dep-gate is the *weakest link* (``min``) over the claim's own
      local quality and its dependency finals — NOT the product down the chain.
      This makes solidity refactor-invariant: splitting one derivation step
      into two same-quality steps leaves it unchanged, and a deep clean chain
      does not decay toward 0 as a granularity artifact (ordinal confidence
      grades are not independent probabilities to be multiplied).
    * Propagation uses each dependency's *rounded* solidity, so a human
      auditing ``min(0.85, 0.41, 0.28)`` against the written values gets the
      same answer the tool does.

    HARD RULE — ``*pending*`` propagates transitively, exactly like NaN
    through arithmetic. A claim's solidity is ``*pending*`` (undefined) if its
    ``confidence`` is ``*pending*`` (parsed as ``None`` — not yet quality
    assessed) OR any of its dependencies' solidity is ``*pending*``,
    REGARDLESS of the claim's own local ``confidence``. A claim with
    ``confidence: 1.0`` that depends on one pending claim still has a pending
    solidity. Framework-node dependencies (invariant / axiom targets) are
    never pending — they are solidity-1.0 bedrock by definition, so a claim
    that depends only on framework nodes is NOT pending (its solidity equals
    its confidence).

    A claim with a pending solidity is OMITTED from the returned mapping: the
    dict contains an entry only for claims with a fully-computable numeric
    solidity. Every consumer must treat "absent from this result" identically
    to "pending" — render/record it as ``*pending*`` / ``null``. The current
    KB is a closed subgraph (no numeric-confidence claim depends on a pending
    claim), so the blocked-by-pending-dependency path is dormant; it activates
    the first time a volume is assessed while a volume it depends on is still
    pending.

    Returns ``{claim_id: solidity}`` for every claim with a computable
    solidity. Raises :class:`SolidityCycleError` if the depends-on graph
    contains a cycle — over every claim, including the ones this mapping omits
    as pending, because a cycle is a property of the edges and not of the

    :data:`kb_schema.NODE_KINDS`, discriminated by ``node_type``. Each kind's
    record shape differs, which is why each is emitted by its own branch below:

    * ``claim`` records carry the full 15-field shape (``node_type`` first,
      then the 14 claim fields, including ``derivation_solidity`` and
      ``experimental_solidity`` before ``solidity``).
    * ``support`` records carry the five identifying fields plus ``quality``
      and the ``solidity`` the shared computation derived for them.
    * ``experiment`` records are minimal — six fields (``node_type``, ``id``,
      ``title``, ``canonical_path``, ``canonical_anchor``, ``status``).
    * ``invariant`` / ``axiom`` records are minimal — exactly the five
      identifying fields. Framework nodes are solidity-1.0 by definition, so
      they carry no scoring fields.
    * ``work`` records carry the five identifying fields plus ``strength``.

    The sort key ``(node_type, id)`` groups the kinds in ASCII order of the
    discriminator, which is the file's own order and not the vocabulary's.

    Claim counts (depends_on_count, strengthen_by_count, citation_count) are
    derived from the same state so they're internally consistent with the
    other record files this module emits. ``depends_on_count`` counts only
    ``relation:"depends"`` edges.

    ``derivation_solidity`` / ``experimental_solidity`` / ``solidity`` /
    ``build_status`` / ``build_band`` are **derived** — computed by
    :func:`compute_solidity_full` from the hand-authored ``confidence`` values,
    the depends-on DAG, and run-experiment strengthens edges, NOT re-parsed
    from the claim-quality.md ``solidity`` line. ``build_status`` / ``build_band``
    derive from the FINAL solidity. A claim whose final solidity is pending
    carries ``null`` for ``solidity`` / ``build_status``.

      ``strength:null``, ``fraction:null``. A support's own deps are ``depends``

      block (``source: exp-id``, ``target: clm-id``, ``strength:<value>``,
      ``fraction:null``).
    * ``supports`` edges come from each support leaf's ``supports:`` block
      (``source: sup-id``, ``target: clm-id``, ``relation:"supports"``,
      ``target_kind:"claim"``, ``strength:null``, ``fraction:<f>`` where

      pending-fraction literal is distinct on disk from a depends edge's
      ``fraction:null``. The DERIVATION-branch analog of a ``strengthens`` edge.
    * ``rests-on`` edges come from a claim entry's own depends-on bullets, the
      ones whose target is a ``work-`` id (``source: clm-id``,
      ``target: work-<key>``, ``target_kind:"work"``, ``strength:null``,

      gate: an applicability above zero puts the work's ``strength`` into the
      source's dependency ``min``, a zero one takes the pairing out of it, and
      either left unsupplied keeps the source pending.
