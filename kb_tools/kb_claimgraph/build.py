"""The declared pass: the tree in, the claims the author marked authored into it.

Six stages, run in order. Every one of them terminates on a comparison between
two artifacts or on a return code; none exits on an opinion, and none asks
whether the work is good enough.

**Mechanical end to end.** This pass identifies the claims the author marked and
spends no inference. The two stages that do — claim discovery over the unmarked
documents (:mod:`discover`) and dependency attribution (:mod:`depends`) — are
separate entry points over this pass's output, because a failed or improved
inference must not cost the mechanical work that preceded it and must be
re-runnable without rebuilding the tree.

**This pass's output is a lower bound and says so in its report.** The claims it
authors are the ones the corpus marked; the ones it did not look for are named
by count, and the documents carrying no author-marked block carry a reason that
states the run's scope rather than a finding about the document — which is also
the sentence claim discovery reads as its admission ticket.
