"""Claim discovery — stage C-inf, over the documents the author marked nothing in.

**The missing middle.** The declared pass authors the claims the author marked;
stage D attributes dependencies over an authored graph. Between them sits the
question neither asks: what does a document nobody marked actually state. This
pipeline asks it, once per document, and mints a claim node per record.

Six stages, in order, and every one of them terminates on a comparison between
two artifacts or on a return code:

* **C1, :mod:`conform`** — the same structural checks and the same per-document
  partition ``--pass 2`` runs. This stage's scope is
  :attr:`~conform.PassTwoState.awaiting` and nothing else; a document carrying a
  ``claims:`` list or an authored reason is somebody's finding and is not this
  pass's to reopen.
* **C2, :mod:`inventory`** — the same scan. Three of its readings are used: that
  the documents in scope carry no claim-bearing block (asserted rather than
  assumed, because it is what keeps this stage and C-mech from double-counting
  if the scope ever widens), the maths-fence extents, and — through the
  inventory the ask is composed from — nothing else.
* **C3 and C4, :mod:`identify`** — the ask and the checks over what comes back.
  This is the whole of C-inf's inference.
* **C5, :func:`write.write_claims`** — three of the write path's four passes,
  scoped to one document. Per document, so that a stopped run resumes.
* **C6, :mod:`gate`** — the runner's refresh and verify. Preceded by this
  stage's own exit condition: **no document in the run's scope is left
  unsettled**, which is a comparison over the tree the run just wrote and is
  what says the stage finished rather than stopped quietly. A document
  identification could anchor nothing in leaves awaiting by carrying a reason of
  its own, so it satisfies this condition rather than halting on it — and is
  reported by name, because a state that exits awaiting quietly is the silent
  zero this whole pipeline exists to remove.

**No number is authored and no edge is.** Every entry's rigor is the pending
literal, and dependency attribution runs afterward from :mod:`depends`, over a
graph that by then includes what this stage minted.

**A run is resumable and a re-run is a partial no-op.** Discovery costs an ask
per document, so an interrupted run is the ordinary case rather than the
exceptional one. There is no transcript replay: a re-run costs inference again
for every document still awaiting, and nothing for one that is not.
