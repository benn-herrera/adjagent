"""Stage G — refresh, then verify, through the consuming project's runner targets.

**This is the loop that works: it exits on a subprocess return code.** There is
no fix loop here and no seat to run one. Every check these targets make compares
one mechanical product against another — a rebuild diffed against disk, a link
against the file it names, an id against the register that mints it — so a red
gate is a defect in this stage's input or in this stage, and neither is repaired
by asking.

The targets are reached by name, never by invoking the modules behind them: the
runner include line is what a consuming project gains the targets through, and
running the modules directly would be the ad-hoc invocation project policy
forbids. Which runner is in front of them is read off the root rather than
assumed.
