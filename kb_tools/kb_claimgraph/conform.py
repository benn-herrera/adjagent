"""Stage A — the conformance gate over SPEC.md's Document-Tree Contract.

**A non-conforming tree does not produce a missing graph, it produces a wrong
one.** So the run opens here, writes nothing, and stops on the first failed
assertion naming the point it belongs to. The check is cheap because the
contract is mechanical, and it is not a defensive parser: it *asserts* the
guarantees rather than tolerating their absence. A tolerant reader would be
building for a contract that does not exist while the one that does went
unenforced.

**The cleanliness check is the declared pass's double-run guard.** That pass
mints ids; a second run over its own output would mint a second set and double
the graph. Point 14 guarantees a fresh tree carries none of the artifacts it
writes, so the presence of any one of them means the input is not a fresh tree,
and :func:`gate` refuses.

**The discovered pass's entry condition is a different one, and it is per
document.** That pass extends the tree additively — SPEC declares nodes
additively in leaf frontmatter — so a whole-tree refusal on "any frontmatter at
all" would forbid it entirely. What it must not do is re-mint, so the question
moves from the tree to the document: :func:`determination` says whether one
document has already had its claim declaration settled, and
:func:`pass_two_gate` partitions the tree by that answer.

**The forbidden artifacts are read off the module that composes them**
(:data:`tree.METADATA_OPENERS`, itself read off :mod:`kb_tools.kb_write.render`)
rather than re-typed here. A cleanliness check carrying its own copy of the
spellings would pass a tree holding an artifact whose spelling had since moved,
which is the silent-clean failure this gate exists to prevent.

**One clause of point 14 is not checked, and that is a ruling rather than an
omission.** Point 14 also forbids a ``.index/`` directory, and what it describes
is what the *front end* leaves behind. Between that front end and this stage
runs ``graph-init``, whose landed behaviour is to create ``.index/`` and install
the runner include line over an already-populated tree (ARCHITECTURE.md,
Initialising the Claim-Graph Spine). Refusing on its presence here would refuse
every run of this stage as designed. Derived space is out of this gate's scope
in both directions: nothing under it is authored, and nothing this stage writes
lands there.
