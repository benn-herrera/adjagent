"""Dependency attribution: the edges between the claims the graph already holds.

**The passes are separate because inference is the part that needs repeating.**
A failed or improved inferential pass must not cost the mechanical work, and
must be re-runnable against a different model or a better ask without rebuilding
the tree. That is an operational property, and it is why this is a second
entry point over the first's output rather than a branch inside it.

**It runs after claim discovery** (:mod:`discover`), over a graph that by then
includes the claims nobody marked. Nothing here mints a node, and nothing there
authors an edge.

Stages, in order:

* **A′, :mod:`conform`** — the same structural checks the declared pass makes,
  and in place of its cleanliness check the per-document entry condition:
  :func:`conform.pass_two_gate`.
* **B, :mod:`inventory`** — the same scan. The tree gained metadata and no
  prose, so every claim site it found before is where it was.
* **:mod:`graph`** — the authored claim graph, read back off the tree's own
  declarations and registers.
* **D, :mod:`attribute`** — the narrowing, which settles an edge outright where
  containment directs it, demotes to a ``references`` edge any settled edge
  lying on a cycle, and offers a candidate pair where containment directs
  nothing; then one bounded selection per source claim over what is left, and
  the two mechanical checks that bound it. Inference reaches it through
  :mod:`ask`'s injected seam, which is why this pipeline takes a selector rather
  than building one.
* **F′, :func:`write.write_edges`** — pass 3 of the write path, one batch.
* **G, :mod:`gate`** — the runner's refresh and verify targets. Exits on the
  return code.

**Nothing here exits on a model's opinion.** Every stage ends on a comparison
between two artifacts or on a return code, and the one inference is asked for a
selection from a set it did not choose.

**Only the asking is conditional.** ``selector=None`` is a run with no model
reachable, and every stage above still runs: the entry condition, the inventory,
the authored graph, the narrowing, the acyclicity check over what it settled,
the write and the gates. What such a run does without is the selection over the
pairs containment left open — those pairs carry no ``depends`` edge — so its
dependency set is a subset of what a full run authors, never a different one.
The report says which run it was on its own line, in both directions, because a
corpus that left no pair open and a build that could not ask about the ones it
did are otherwise the same silence.

**What such a run does not do without is the cross-references themselves.**
Every open pair is recorded as a ``references`` edge either way
(:mod:`attribute`): the corpus states that one claim's text names another, and
that statement is not conditional on a model being reachable. A full run
differs only in that pairs the selection raised to dependencies are recorded as
dependencies instead.
