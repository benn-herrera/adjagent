"""This package's two inferences: what is asked, how it is asked, what is read back.

**Inference arrives by injection, as a seat and a prompt** —
:class:`SeatAsk`, satisfied in production by
:func:`kb_tools.inference.ask_seat`. That signature is the whole of this
module's dependency on the machinery behind it: a seat name and a prompt go in,
response text and an :class:`~kb_tools.inference.Outcome` come back, and nothing
about argv, a subprocess, a process group or a stream format is visible here.
The layer that satisfies it knows the agent set and nothing about this KB; the
layer under *that* knows neither.

**Neither ask is written here.** Both are templates under
``kb_driver/prompt-templates/``, filled through
:func:`kb_tools.kb_driver.prompt_templates.render`, so an ask lands in a diff as
prose and can be read end to end by the person who writes prose. Two mechanisms
carry what varies, and which one a condition takes turns on what it does to the
ask. Where a specific needs tailoring and the question is unchanged, the
alternatives are **fragments** and this module picks one **by name**, the
composer loading and resolving whichever it named: C-inf's display-maths
section, the correction a re-ask of either stage carries, and the evidence
C-inf's per-claim re-ask shows. Where the question itself differs, there is an
**alternate template**: stage D's acyclicity re-ask, and C-inf's per-claim
re-ask, which asks about one claim where the ask before it asked about a
document. No template carries a conditional, and nothing here composes prose or
holds any — a choice is all that leaves this module for a prompt, beside the
values a call computes and the markers in :data:`MARKER_SLOTS`.

**Nothing usage-specific happens on the way back, either.** The response is
text, and each parse below is its stage's own —
:mod:`kb_tools.kb_driver.envelope`'s record toolkit, which extracts a marked
block, decodes it, checks a closed vocabulary in both directions, and reads
every key carrying words out of a raw block beside the JSON. Parse only, never
quality. Neither answer has a verdict field, a confidence field or free text,
because there is nothing in either for a model to say about its own work.

**Nothing either seat composes or quotes travels inside JSON**, and each ask
declares which transport each of its keys travels in (:data:`LEVELS`, proved a
partition of the key vocabulary at import). Stage D declares JSON and nothing
else: its answer is a claim id and an array of candidate ids, and nothing there
is composed. That declaration is still work rather than a formality — it is
**an empty prose vocabulary**, and what it buys is that a stray prose block in a
stage-D answer is a refusal instead of something nobody looked for. C-inf
declares the opposite: no JSON at all, and a closed set of single-line fields in
a raw block (:data:`CLAIM_FIELDS`).

**Two failure paths, and they are different failures.** A call that did not
complete is re-issued *identically* while the layer below calls its outcome
retryable, bounded by :data:`TRANSPORT_ATTEMPTS` — the same shape the write
path applies to the write API's retry code, and not a fix loop: the prompt does
not change and nothing is asked about the failure. A call the layer below calls
unretryable stops the stage at once. Neither is a stage's re-ask, which is spent
on an answer that **arrived**. A parse refusal is
:class:`~.report.AnswerFormatError`, declared in :mod:`report` because this
module imports from both of the stages that catch it.

**A re-ask carries a fact computed after the previous answer, or it is a spent
call.** Re-issuing the question with the rule restated went out twice against
one live document and came back with the same slip in the same place. So stage
D's acyclicity re-ask carries the cycle the answers so far close, and C-inf's
per-claim re-ask carries the sentences the tool actually found — with an
explicit "none of these", because a forced choice over a narrowed window gets
confidently answered even when the right sentence lies outside it.

**Stage D's ask is a selection from an enumerated set.** One source claim, the
candidate targets that stage D's mechanical narrowing offered it, and the
reference lines those candidates were enumerated from. What comes back is a
subset of the ids that were handed over.

**Stage C-inf's ask is the one open-ended reading in this build.** One document,
rendered one labelled sentence per line (:mod:`label`), and what results it
states — each as a self-contained block carrying the **quote** the result begins
at, the **label** of that sentence, and a **title** the seat authors.

**The model quotes; the tool addresses.** The quote is a lookup key and never
content: it resolves to a sentence, and then it is discarded and the tool cuts
the bytes, so no model-typed byte reaches the KB and there is still nothing for
a verbatimness check to establish. What changes against the shape before it is
that the address is now **verified** rather than trusted — a label the seat
named alone was a pointer, and a wrong pointer is a well-formed record aimed at
the wrong span that no downstream check can tell from a right one. The label
survives as the cross-check that catches exactly that divergence
(:mod:`identify`).

**Both go to the same seat, and it is a constructor parameter in both.** The
seat's native discipline is verbatim correspondence, which is the one property
either stage can check, and a seat whose instincts and whose gate agree fails
visibly rather than plausibly. It stays injected so a run can move it.

**The seam is what makes both testable.** Every check over either stage runs
against a fixed :class:`SeatAsk`, because a check that needs a model to be
reachable is a check that does not run.
