"""Shared utility and vocabulary module for the KB toolchain.

Two kinds of single-sourced truth live here: KB path construction and the
maintenance-command hints that build-side scripts emit in remediation text.

Both the build-side scripts (``kb_tools/``) and the read-side query package
(``kb_tools/kb_cmd/``) resolve every ``kb-root/`` path through this module
rather than constructing the literals themselves.

Root discovery is lazy and cwd-anchored: the consuming repo's root is found
by :func:`find_repo_root`, which walks up from the current working directory
to the first directory containing a ``.git`` entry (a directory, or the file
a linked git worktree carries) and requires the ``kb-root/`` content tree
beside it. Nothing is ever derived from ``__file__``: the toolchain is an
installed copy under ``.claude/agents/``, so ``__file__`` only ever describes
where the tools were installed, not the repo being worked on.

Maintenance-command hints (:func:`refresh_cmd` / :func:`verify_cmd`) are
detected, not configured: a ``justfile`` at the detected root selects
``just <target>``, a ``Makefile`` selects ``make <target>`` (justfile wins
when both are present), and with neither the hint falls back to the raw
``python3 -m kb_tools.<module>`` invocation, which always works.

The module doubles as the KB build's mechanical front end. Run as a CLI —
``python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util <op> [options]`` — it manages the single include
line through which a consuming repo's runner (justfile or Makefile) gains
the KB maintenance targets (``install-targets`` / ``uninstall-targets``);
initialises the claim-graph metadata spine over an already-built document tree
under ``graph-init`` (index directory, include line, refresh, verify); reports
the build environment
under ``preflight``; and drives the build's stage ledger through
``show-status`` / ``start-build`` / ``advance-step``, with ``show-stage-status``
reading one stage's coverage beside them.

The target definitions themselves ship in ``runner-snippets/`` (``kb.just`` /
``kb.mk``) and are included from the installed tree, never copied into the
consumer's file.

``validate-build`` joins that op set as the built-tree validator's front end:
handed a KB tree, it walks that tree and checks its structure. The tree is the
whole of what it is told, and the tree is produced upstream of this op.

``show-run-lock`` reports the driver's run lock — live, stale or absent, with
the holder named where there is one — so a caller outside ``kb_driver`` (a
staging recipe about to wipe a workspace) can ask whether a build is running in
this repository. It writes nothing, clears nothing, and restates nothing: the
judgement is ``kb_driver.runlog.lock_state``'s, and its own answer rides its
stdout rather than its exit status.

The nine metadata **write** ops — ``insert-claim-entry``,
``insert-support-entry``, ``insert-experiment-entry``, ``set-rigor``,
``set-rationale``, ``add-depends-on``, ``set-frontmatter``,
``mark-claim-in-leaf`` and ``set-on-point-fraction`` — join the set as the front
end of ``kb_write``. Each takes its values in a TOML
file named by ``--values`` rather than on the command line, and the two register
inserts alone take ``--create``. Their semantics — the validation ladder, the
refusal reasons, the report lines and the three exit codes — live entirely in
``kb_write.ops`` with no argparse in the picture; what is here is the surface
binding and one adapter, so nothing about an op changes when its surface does.

Each op is an ``argparse`` subcommand owning its own options, so a companion
that belongs to one op cannot be spelled on another: an invalid pairing is
unrepresentable rather than policed.

Stdlib only.
