"""Op semantics for the claim-graph sheet: discovery, load, selection, report.

The op is :func:`render`. The ``render-claim-graph`` subcommand binds it, and
anything else that wants a sheet on disk calls it directly — it takes no
argparse, reads no ``sys.argv`` and calls no ``sys.exit``. It returns a
:class:`Result` carrying the exit code, the report lines and the path it wrote;
printing and exiting are the surface's.

:func:`compose` is the same work stopping one step short, at the markup: what a
caller that wants the bytes rather than the file asks for. ``verify``'s
freshness gate is that caller — it renders the sheet the index on disk would
produce and byte-compares it against the sheet beside it, the way it diffs a
dry-run rebuild of ``.index/`` against the files there.

**The only precondition is that the index loads.** No property of the graph is
one: zero edges, one node, every node isolated, a graph with nothing in it at
all — each is a true picture of the KB that produced it, and the seeded spine
whose sheet nobody can draw yet is the dependency-order failure this rules out.

**It reads ``.index/`` and emits one file.** Nothing else under ``kb-root/`` is
opened, and nothing under ``.index/`` is ever written — that tree is refresh's,
which regenerates it wholesale and which verify diffs a dry-run rebuild against.

**Where the sheet lands**: ``claim-graph.svg`` at the KB root, beside
``claim-quality.md``, unless ``out`` names another path. The sheet is a pure
derived view of ``.index/``, so it belongs beside the KB it derives from rather
than wherever the caller happened to be standing.

**The exit ladder**, against the house's existing meanings: ``0`` rendered,
``2`` the environment is unfit, ``7`` refused. **No graph content produces a
non-zero exit.** A cycle, an edge naming an id no record carries, an isolated
node and a whole disconnected component are the picture's subject; an instrument
that raises on the defect it exists to show is worse than no instrument.

**Two layers reach exit 2 and they do not overlap by accident.** This module
pre-checks the index directory itself, so the common failure is refused before a
load is attempted; and it maps the loader's own ``FileNotFoundError`` and
``ValueError`` to the same code **carrying that message unaltered** — it already
names the missing files and the refresh command to run, or the ``path:lineno``
of a malformed record, and rewriting it would lose the only detail the caller
can act on.

Beyond the package's own modules this reaches :mod:`kb_tools.kb_cmd.index` for
the load, :mod:`kb_tools.kb_util` for the KB path vocabulary and the report
tokens, and :mod:`kb_tools.kb_schema` for the node-kind census order.
