"""On-demand inference, in two layers, for any tooling that wants some.

* :mod:`claude` — one headless ``claude`` call: spawn, stream capture,
  watchdog, process-group kill, and the one classification of how a call ended.
  It knows the CLI's shape and nothing else — not this agent set, not a KB, not
  this repository. :func:`invoke` returns the whole :class:`CallResult`;
  :func:`call_claude` builds the argv, spools the prompt, and returns the
  response text and the outcome.
* :mod:`seat` — one call to a named seat of this agent set, built on the
  first: :func:`ask_seat` invokes the seat as an agent with its tools, and
  :func:`ask_reader` puts a question to it with none, its definition's body as
  the system prompt. It knows what a seat is and how to name one, and nothing
  about what a seat is being asked to do.

Neither parses what comes back beyond taking the response text out of the
stream, and neither retries: policy of every kind — retry, a re-ask, where a
bound's value comes from, one call at a time — is the caller's. Both are tested
against a substituted invoker, so nothing here needs a reachable model.
