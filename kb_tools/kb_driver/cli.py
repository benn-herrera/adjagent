"""Argparse, mode dispatch, and exit-code translation.

The driver's outermost layer, and the one that guarantees that every
terminating path — including the ones that never reach the sequencer, like a
config error or a held lock — leaves through :func:`main`, which renders the
relay baton for the code it is about to return. The relay reads a card; it
never remembers a protocol.

This layer holds no pipeline logic and no stage knowledge. It loads config,
takes the run lock (``pre.lock``), lays out the run directory, starts logging,
and hands control to the stage sequencer.

A run is launchable with no file to compose first: ``--source`` (repeatable)
carries the one ``[run]`` field that has no default, ``--permission-mode``
overrides the mode ``config`` defaults, and every other field keeps the default
``config`` holds. ``--config`` stays, and the two combine — the flag wins for
the field it names, which is the precedence ``--decide`` already has over the
config's ``[barriers.*]`` tables. Composing the flags and the file is
``config.load``'s; this layer only reads which flags were given.

The effective permission mode is announced on the way in, in the message rather
than the log record's context, because the console tee prints messages alone: a
run whose mode nobody chose still says what it is dispatching under and which
flag changes it.

**One flag changes what a run is made of.** ``--no-inference`` promises that no
model call is spent, and it is the sequencer's rather than this layer's: every
row that would cost one is dropped and the walk carries on past it, so a build
under it closes out real and inference-free. Which rows those are is the step
table's (``steps.Step.spends_inference``); this layer holds no stage knowledge
and does not acquire any to announce the flag.

Both barrier doors are validated here, against the registry ``barriers.py``
holds: ``config.load`` and ``config.parse_decision`` each take the admissible
answers, so an unknown pair or an inadmissible answer is exit 13 **at load** —
before a run directory exists and before anything is spawned. A typo cannot
become a mid-build stop three hours in.

**A run that dies abnormally still leaves its report.** Once the run directory
exists, every way out of the sequencer writes ``cadence.jsonl`` and
``exit.json`` (``run.write_report``) — a boundary check that failed, a
terminating signal, an exception no handler names, alongside the endings the
walk chose. Those are the endings that most need one: their own card calls the
run directory the bug report, and an ending nobody planned is the one least
likely to have said anything legible on the way out. The exception-to-exit
mapping is :func:`_terminal`, read by that path and by :func:`main`'s
last-resort handler alike, so a failure raised inside the run and the same
failure raised a frame higher cannot report different codes.

Stdlib only.
