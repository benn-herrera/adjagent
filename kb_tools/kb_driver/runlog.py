"""Logging, the run-directory layout, and the boundary check.

All driver output goes through this module: JSONL to ``<run-dir>/run.log``,
tee'd to the console at the same level. Writing to a console stream directly is
permitted in the driver for exactly two things, and both live here. :func:`relay`
is stdout's — relayed tool stdout and the relay baton, written verbatim, because
a card the session must paste cannot carry a log prefix. :func:`notify` is
stderr's — a notice about the invocation itself, kept off the stream a session
pastes from. Each records its own text in the JSONL log as evidence and each
suppresses the console tee's copy, so the bytes reach a console exactly once.

Run-directory layout — the run directory is a sibling of
``.claude-temp/kb-build/``, not a subdirectory: that layout is a contract
governing build *artifacts*, while these are *evidence* nothing in the
pipeline reads::

    <repo-root>/.claude-temp/kb-driver.lock   the run lock (one per REPO)

    <parent>/                            default .claude-temp/kb-driver
      LATEST                             (at the parent)
      <run-id>/
        run.log · run.pid · exit.json
        briefs/ · calls/ · barriers/
        deviations.jsonl · cadence.jsonl

The lock is deliberately *not* under ``<parent>``. LATEST is about this run's
evidence and belongs beside it; the lock is about the repository, and anchoring
it at the run-directory parent made it per-``--run-dir`` — two invocations
passing different ``--run-dir`` (which kb-testing is required to do) would take
different locks and both proceed against one KB.

Whether a lock is live, stale or absent is one judgement — :func:`lock_state` —
read by the acquire path here and, from outside the driver, by ``kb_util``'s
read-only ``show-run-lock`` op. A caller that needs the answer asks it; a second
pid test is a second definition of a live run.

Turning a terminating signal into an ordinary unwind lives here too
(:func:`terminating_signals`), beside the directory it exists to protect: a run
killed on the default disposition writes nothing, and what it would have written
is the only account of itself it leaves.

Stdlib only.
