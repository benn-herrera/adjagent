"""Subprocess adapter over the sanctioned `kb_tools` ops, front ends and runner targets.

The ledger is the git commit trail, and it is written only by ``kb_util
start-build`` / ``advance-step``, invoked as a subprocess. Nothing
here imports `kb_pipeline` internals and nothing here runs git. The tool's
**complete stdout is relayed verbatim** through :func:`runlog.relay`: this
module contains no checklist formatting and never trims a render, including on
the failure paths, where the refusal render carries the card that is the fix.

What the adapter adds is the rc→exit mapping, so that a tool exit code becomes
a driver exit code in exactly one place:

| Op | tool rc | driver exit |
|---|---|---|
| ``preflight`` | 0 · 1 · 2 | 0 · 14 · 14 |
| ``graph-init`` | 0 · 1 · 2 · 3 | 0 · 11 · 14 · 14 |
| ``start-build`` | 0 · 5 · 4 · 6 · 2 | 0 · 0 (already started reads as done) · 14 · 19 · 14 |
| ``advance-step`` | 0 · 4 · 6 · 2 | 0 · 14 · 19 · 14 |
| ``show-status`` | 0 · 2 | 0 · 14 |
| ``kb_docgraph`` | 0 · 1 · 2 | 0 · 11 · 14 |
| ``kb_claimgraph`` | 0 · 1 · 2 · 3 | 0 · 11 · 14 · 14 |
| runner target | 0 · other | 0 · 11 |

An rc outside its op's vocabulary is a driver/tool contract violation, not a
pipeline outcome: it routes through :func:`runlog.require` and exits 15.

**Dependency note.** ``ledger`` depends on ``runlog``. Naming an exit code
additionally requires ``baton``, the stateless exit-code vocabulary; copying
the constants here instead would be exactly the drift the single-source rule
exists to prevent.

Stdlib only.
