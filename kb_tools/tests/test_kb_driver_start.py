"""The ``start`` stage's rows, and the one thing that tells a launch from a resume.

There is no build mode. An invocation that finds ``start`` unrecorded is
opening a build and walks this stage; one that finds it recorded is continuing
a build and skips every row of it. That single fact carries the launch guard:
``pre.kb-root`` refuses to open a build over a ``kb-root/`` holding documents
this build did not write, and never fires on a resume, because a resume never
reaches it.

The ledger is a fake here, as it is in ``test_kb_driver_buildout.py``: the
subject is which rows the walk runs and what they read off the filesystem, and
a real commit trail behind every case would be a second suite's answer to a
question this one asks of the loop. What is real is the reading — the guard
calls ``kb_util.kb_root_state`` against a directory this file lays down.
