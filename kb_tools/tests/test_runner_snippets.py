"""Tests for the installed runner fragments themselves — ``runner-snippets/``.

The delivered artifact is a justfile fragment and a Makefile fragment, so these
cases drive the real ``just`` and ``make`` over them, in a scratch consuming
repo whose ``<harness-dir>/agents`` symlinks to this repository's agents surface,
with the include lines written by the installed ``install-targets`` itself. That
is the shape the fragments document; anything less exercises a copy of the
recipe rather than the recipe.

The property under test is ``kb-verify``'s composite contract: all three
verifiers run, and the target carries the worst outcome. It is a gate contract
rather than a formatting one — the driver's validation gate stops the build on
this target's exit code and puts its captured stdout in the run log, so a report
covering one verifier's faults sends whoever reads it after a third of the
problem.
