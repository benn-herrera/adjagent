"""Unit tests over the claim-graph builder's mechanical stages.

What is tested here is logic whose right answer is independently verifiable: the
display-line parse, the fence scan's two contract traps, the closed environment
table, the kind derivation, the values transport's round trip, and each
conformance point refusing the tree that violates it. What is *not* tested here
is the pipeline end to end — that is ``just claimgraph-corpus``, which runs the
real builder over the real tree in an installed consumer and exits on the
runner's own gates.
