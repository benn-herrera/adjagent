"""The readiness-doc templates resolve where the pipeline looks for them.

``stamp_readiness_docs`` reads these two files at phase-3a of a real build,
after the whole head has run, where a resource that moved without its lookup
surfaces as a stage failure with no obvious cause. These tests fail at the
move instead.
