"""Baton completeness.

Every enumerated exit code renders a baton, and an unlisted code renders the
fallback: an unrecognized exit state is the one place a relaying session will
otherwise improvise.

One case here is not a unit case. A card's ASK and THEN RUN are the operator's
next action, so what must hold of a stage-record refusal's card is that the
action it names exists *for the row that produced it* — which means the code has
to arrive from the real refusal rather than from a constant transcribed beside
it. That case drives ``kb_pipeline`` through the ledger adapter against a temp
git repo, the way ``test_kb_driver_ledger.py`` does.
