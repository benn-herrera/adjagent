"""The discovered pass: its entry condition, and dependency attribution end to end.

**Every test here runs against a fake inference.** The seam is
:class:`kb_tools.kb_claimgraph.ask.SeatAsk` — a seat and a prompt in, response
text and an `Outcome` out — and the fake reads the prompt the stage actually
composed and answers from a fixed table. So the ask, the reply parse, both
transport failure paths, the candidate-membership check, the acyclicity check
and the write are all exercised, and none of it needs a model to be reachable: a
check that cannot run without one is a check that does not run.

The consuming repository is stood up the way a consumer's is: the real runner
snippet, imported by the line the installer writes, over the installed package.
That is what makes the last stage's targets the real ones rather than a
justfile this file invented.
