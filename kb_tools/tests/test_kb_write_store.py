"""The store module's contract, as tests.

Three proofs, and the three classes below carry them.

**The readback-failure injection.** A deliberately broken renderer — the
marker rendered above its own heading — is fed through the real write path.
Every insert must refuse, the live file must be byte-unchanged, and no temp
may survive. This is the only test that proves the readback and the
all-or-nothing guarantee are load-bearing rather than decorative: if the
readback were absent, or ran against the live file instead of the temp, these
inserts would succeed and silently lose their records.

Two shapes of the injection are exercised because the parser fails them
differently, and a test that caught only one would leave the other class open.
Into an empty register the misplaced marker has no preceding ``## `` heading at
all and yields **no record**, so the temp's census sees a marker with nothing
behind it. Into a populated register it binds to the *previous* entry's heading
and yields a record with the wrong title, which the counts cannot see — the
temp's census sees the *binding* instead, and the field-by-field comparison
alone would miss this shape whenever the values happen to match. Both
refusals are still on the temp, with the live file unwritten.

**A planted census mismatch is refused before anything is composed.** The
fixture is the frozen 2026-09-02 corpus itself, which carries the defect
in its own bytes: every marker sits above its heading, so the first one binds to
nothing and the register's records are one short of its markers. The splice
callable in that test raises if it is ever called, which is how "before anything
is composed" is asserted rather than assumed.

**The forced interleaving.** Two writers, one register, one deterministic
ordering — the second writer completes inside the first's splice callable, which
is the real seam between the first writer's read and its replace. No test-only
hook exists in ``store.py`` for this: the splice is caller-supplied, so a test
splice with a side effect is enough, and a production surface that exists only
for tests would be its own defect. The first writer must return *retry*, not
*refused*, and the register must hold exactly one new entry with a passing
census.

**The exclusion the check and the replace run under.** The forced interleaving
above proves the check catches a writer that finished *before* it ran; it says
nothing about one that lands between the check and the replace, which is the
interleaving a real wave of concurrent writers produces. Closing it made the
check-then-replace sequence a critical section, and
:class:`TestTheReplaceRunsUnderAnExclusion` asserts that section is there: with
the directory held by somebody else, a writer that would have replaced anyway
waits instead, and then answers *retry* rather than publishing over the
holder. The outcome the section exists for — a wave of real processes losing
nothing — is ``test_writeapi_concurrency.py``, because no in-process seam can
put a second writer inside that window.

The remaining classes cover the boundaries this module also owns: path
containment, strict UTF-8, explicit register creation, all-or-nothing
batching, the splice primitives, and the structural instrument that keeps the
by-name exclusion honest.

**No test asserts a report string's wording** — only the status, the
reason token, and the named identity.
