"""What a resuming invocation reads, and what it says about an answer it did not use.

Two properties, and they are two halves of one defect. A row that needed a
reading taken by a row of an *earlier stage* got it from an instance attribute,
so on an invocation that resumes past that stage the attribute held its
constructor default: ``spine-seed.runner-choice`` could not be raised on any
resume, and a ``--decide`` answer for it went nowhere. The first half is fixed
by taking the reading at the point of use; the second is fixed by saying so,
because an answer that decided nothing must not be silent.

The ledger is a fake, as it is in ``test_kb_driver_start.py``: the subject is
which rows the walk runs and what they read off the filesystem. What is real is
the reading — the seed row asks ``kb_util.detected_runner`` about a directory
this file lays down, with a runner file in it or without.
