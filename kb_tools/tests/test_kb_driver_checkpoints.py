"""What a resume re-spends, and what the last boundary has already paid for.

Successful expensive work is never discarded, and a stage boundary is what says
it was earned (SPEC.md, The Driver's Contract). Three properties follow, and this
file is all three over the head's own rows:

* a row whose boundary landed is not walked again, so its call is not re-issued;
* a row whose boundary did *not* land is walked again, because an output no
  boundary accounts for is discarded rather than reconciled;
* neither case asks an operator anything. A lost boundary is not a wedge: the
  next invocation reads the recorded set, finds the stage missing, and re-runs it.

**The inference is a stub.** ``claims-discovered`` spends its model inside
``kb_claimgraph``, which this suite replaces with a ledger op that counts how many
times it was invoked. That count is the whole subject — what the walk *asks for* a
second time is decided by the recorded set and by nothing else, and asking it of a
real model would price the same assertion in hours.

The ledger is a fake, as it is in ``test_kb_driver_start.py`` and
``test_kb_driver_resume_state.py``: no git repository, no boundary commits, and a
record that can be made to fail the way a killed process leaves one — the stage's
work done and no entry for it.
