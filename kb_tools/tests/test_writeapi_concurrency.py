"""A wave of real writers against one register loses nothing.

This module drives three concurrent `insert-claim-entry` processes into one
register, twenty-five times, against the code written to prevent exactly that:

* **22 of 25 rounds silently lost an entry** — three writers, three ids printed
  to their callers, one `## ` heading on disk;
* **34 ids were reported `FACT minted` with no entry anywhere in the KB**, which
  is the ghost-id state that must be unconstructible;
* **every writer exited 0** and **every register was left census-consistent**,
  so nothing downstream had anything to notice.

The cause was that the check and the `os.replace` it guards were two adjacent
but unguarded loops: every writer read the same baseline, proved its own temp,
found the baseline still live, and replaced. Whoever replaced last won.

**Why this test drives processes and not `apply_edits`.** The defect is a window
between two statements. An in-process test can only enter that window through a
seam the code offers it, and the one seam `store` offers — the caller-supplied
splice — sits *before* the check, which is the one interleaving the old check
already caught (`test_kb_write_store.py::TestForcedInterleaving`). That test was
green throughout the 22 lost rounds. Nothing short of real processes racing on a
real filesystem puts a second writer *between* the check and the replace, so
that is what this module does: `python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util insert-claim-entry`,
N at a time, from a working directory inside a synthetic consumer repo, with no
root override — the shape the distiller briefs sanction.

`test_kb_write_store.py::TestTheReplaceRunsUnderAnExclusion` is the other half
of the proof and the deterministic one: it asserts the exclusion itself. This
module asserts the outcome the exclusion exists for.

**The writers retry, because that is the contract.** Exit 8 tells a caller the
values were right and to re-run the identical invocation; a wave in
which every seat honours that contract must end with every seat's entry on disk.
So each writer here runs the bounded retry loop the brief bodies ask an agent
for, and the assertion is the strong one: all N entries land, and the register
holds exactly the entries its writers were told they had written.

**Rounds.** The measured loss rate was 22/25 per round, so a round survives the
defect with probability ≈ 0.12 and :data:`ROUNDS` rounds survive with ≈ 0.12**N
— at ten rounds, about six in ten billion. That is the sizing argument: enough
rounds that a green here is a statement about the code rather than about the
scheduler, and few enough to cost a couple of seconds.
