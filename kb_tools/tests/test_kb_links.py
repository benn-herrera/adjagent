"""Tests for the shared Markdown link primitives (``kb_tools/kb_links.py``).

These primitives back both ``verify_md_links.py`` and the ``kb_cmd``
reverse-find. The behavior-preservation of the verifier refactor is covered by
``test_verify_md_links.py`` (which exercises the same functions through the
verifier module); this file adds a direct smoke test of the shared module and
confirms the verifier really imports the single shared copy.
