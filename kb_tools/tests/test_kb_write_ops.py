"""The write-op registry's contract, as tests.

Four proofs, and the classes below carry them.

**Every refusal fixture exits 7 naming its own identity.** A check failing
for the wrong reason is a failed check, so each fixture asserts the exact name
the report line carries, not merely that something was refused. The control for
all of them is :class:`TestEveryOpWrites`, which drives the whole registry to a
clean write against the same fixture KB — without it a refusal below would be
evidence only that the harness is broken.

**The duplicate-id fixture is caught by ``scan_duplicate_register_ids`` and
demonstrably missed by the inventory.** :class:`TestDuplicateIsInvisible`
asks both functions the same question over the same KB and shows the inventory
answering "clean" — not by reasoning about the code, but by reading its return.
That is the whole reason two functions exist and not one.

**A minted id is provably absent from both scans before use and present after**,
and the draw genuinely re-rolls on a collision: :class:`TestMintFusion` forces
the first draw to land on an id the inventory already holds and asserts the
second is what gets written.

**No op path exists that writes an entry for an unminted id, asserted
structurally.** :class:`TestNoPathWritesAnUnmintedEntry` does not sample op
bodies; it enumerates. An op's inputs are exactly its own parameters plus the
closed values vocabulary of its row in :data:`values.OP_FIELDS`, and the test
walks **every** member of :data:`ops.OPS` asserting that no minting op's two
channels admit a node id, that every edit which raises a record count belongs to
a minting op and carries only ids minted in that call, and that removing the
draw stops every minting op dead. A future op that took an id for insert fails
here rather than shipping.

**No test asserts a report string's wording** — only the status token, the
named identity, the presence of a ``restore:`` clause, and the exit code.

**Two more rows carry the same shape.**
:class:`TestHostedDeclarationsAreProven` injects a renderer that drops each
class of hosted node declaration, and :class:`TestEveryLeafWriteIsProven` walks
the registry so that no future field can join the uncompared set in silence.
:class:`TestAnUndecodableKbFileIsEnvironmentUnfit` plants a file the
store walk cannot decode and asserts the ladder holds — exit 2, the file named,
never a traceback and never an rc outside the three the ladder defines.
