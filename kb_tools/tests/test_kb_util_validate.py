"""The ``validate-build`` op's CLI wiring, and the standing no-downgrade guard
over the option surface it joins.

The wiring half runs a fixture tree through the real argv path —
``kb_util.main([...])``, and once through ``python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util`` as a
subprocess, from a cwd that is not a repo, since the validator reads the tree it
is handed and discovers no root. ``--kb-root`` is the whole of what the op
takes: it walks that tree for the documents it checks, so there is no second
input to plant a disagreement in. The findings reach stdout in the
``[survey-validate] STATUS check detail`` convention, exit 0 iff no ``FAIL``,
and the third rung: a tree that could not be read is exit 2, not a verdict
about it.

**The planted violation here is a reachability one**, and has to be. This
caller holds no path list independent of the tree, so it passes ``paths=None``
and the tree-diff check reports itself inapplicable rather than passing — a
check that cannot fail must not read as one that was confirmed. What the op
still answers is whether every non-root document up-links to the parent its own
path names and whether every document is reachable from the entry point. A
caller holding a separately-derived path list — ``kb_docgraph``, which knows
what it wrote — calls ``kb_survey.validate.validate_build`` directly and gets
the diff for real (`test_kb_docgraph_build.py`); the pre-build mode over a
manifest and a derived skeleton is ``validate_skeleton``, unchanged and
`test_kb_survey_validate.py`'s.

The guard half is the row's real deliverable and is a standing assertion rather
than a spot check. It enumerates the shipped parser's option surface — the
top-level parser **and every subparser under it**, every flag, and for a flag
taking a value every choice it declares — and asserts across every single
assignment, every pair of them, and the maximal combination of all of them
that:

* a planted partition violation never exits 0 and never prints the success line, and
* the mirror: no assignment arms a shape *measurement* into a ``FAIL``.

**The enumeration recurses, and must.** Under subcommands the top-level parser's
``_actions`` holds only ``--help``, ``--version`` and the subparsers action, so a
guard reading it alone would pass vacuously over a surface it cannot see — every
real option now lives on a subparser. :func:`_parsers` walks
``_SubParsersAction.choices`` to reach them, and
:func:`test_the_guard_catches_a_downgrade_named_option_planted_on_a_subparser` is
its teeth check.

**The bound is stated because it is a bound.** Singles, pairs and the maximal
combination is not the full powerset. A downgrade needing exactly three specific
flags together, with every pair of them inert, is not a shape this CLI can express:
argparse binds each option independently, and there is no longer any cross-option
pairing code for a conditional with three-way arity to live in.
``--help`` and ``--version`` are excluded, and only they: both exit during parsing
without reaching an op, so a surface that could not carry them would have to
reimplement argparse. Abbreviations are not enumerated separately because argparse
resolves them to these same actions — the enumeration is over actions, which is
where behavior lives.
