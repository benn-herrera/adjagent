"""The build's head, against a repository holding one paper and no ``kb-root/``.

The state under test is the one the launch command is run against: a consuming
repository carrying the installed toolchain, its LaTeX source, and no KB at all.
Nothing is faked. The document graph converts through the real reader,
``graph-init`` seeds the spine for real, the declared claim-graph pass runs over
the tree that produced, and every boundary is a real commit in a real
repository.

The source is ``fixtures/lamb/`` — a whole paper in twenty lines, committed, so
this file needs nothing staged. A walk over a multi-volume corpus is the
integration suite's (``kb-testing/tests/test_driver_head.py``); what is here is
the head driven over the one paper that ships with the tests.

``--no-inference`` is what lets it go the whole way: every row that would cost a
model call is dropped, so a fresh entry walks past both claim-graph stages and
closes the build out without spending anything.
