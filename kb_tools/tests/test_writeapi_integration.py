"""The integration chain's contract, as tests.

The contract is one sentence with three clauses — *the three-way chain
green, the second refresh byte-identical, and the solidity line untouched by a
score update* — and this module is that sentence, run once as one chain.

**What makes this different from the unit tests.** Those
prove the ops against the semantics module, in process, with ``kb_root`` handed
in. Nothing there exercises the artifact an agent actually invokes. Every call
here goes through ``python3 -m kb_tools.kb_util <op> --values FILE`` as a
subprocess, from a working directory inside a synthetic consumer repo, with no
root override anywhere — argparse, subcommand dispatch, root discovery, the
adapter, the semantics and the process exit code, in the shape the briefs
sanction. ``refresh`` and ``verify`` are subprocesses of their own shipped
entry points for the same reason.

**The chain is the unit, so the fixture is the chain.** :func:`chain` runs the
ten ops in the order a distiller wave runs them — the endcap's work entry and
the citation-carrying rationale a later pass writes onto it among them — then
``refresh``, then the three gates, then a second ``refresh``, then one score
update, capturing what each step produced. The tests below read that capture. A
failure anywhere in the sequence fails the fixture and every test with it,
which is the honest report: a chain does not have independently passing links.

**Only one of the three gates is asserted clean.** ``mini-kb`` is a
reader-test fixture and its own prose names claim ids outside a sanctioned
channel, so ``verify_citations`` and ``verify_md_links`` are red over it before
this chain writes anything. What is asserted of those two is the claim that is
this chain's: neither reports a finding against the register the chain wrote.

**The corpus is one this program did not compose.** ``fixtures/mini-kb`` is the
hand-built KB the reader tests use — stale solidity lines, framework
dependencies, co-hosted supports — copied into a tmp tree and written there.
The one document whose *body* this module authors is the fresh leaf, which is
what the boundary says: the tool owns the metadata, the agent owns the prose.
Not one metadata byte below is typed.

**One clause is proven elsewhere and cited rather than rebuilt.** The census
refusal on a legacy KB is
``test_kb_write_ops.py::TestRefusalFixtures::test_a_register_whose_census_already_fails``,
which drives the frozen 2026-09-02 corpus at a live op. Restating it here would
be a second copy of a proof, not a second proof.
