## Free-Standing Analytical Support

A non-physical analytical support (INVARIANT-S10): no dependencies of its own,
so its sup_solidity equals its quality. It supports two beneficiaries at
different on-point fractions — clm-sb1111 at full relevance (f=1.0) and
clm-sb2222 at half relevance (f=0.50) — a single support fanning out to several
claims (experiment-like fan-out), each lift feeding the beneficiary's DERIVATION
branch (never the experimental/max branch). Support-ness is conferred by hosting
a `sup-id`, not by a `kind`; the container `kind` stays `leaf`.
