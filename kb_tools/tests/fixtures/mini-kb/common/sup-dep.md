## Dep-Gated Analytical Support

A support that consumes its own dependency (clm-aa1111). Its sup_solidity is
dep-gated: round2(quality 0.90 × dep final 0.90) = 0.81, below its quality —
exactly the claim derivation rule applied with `quality` in place of
`confidence`. It supports clm-sb3333 at f=1.0; the lift into clm-sb3333 is the
dep-gated 0.81, not the raw quality.
