"""The run loop's own vocabulary: resume-skip and the driver-wide contracts.

End-to-end walks of the surviving stages (``phase-3a`` through ``phase-5``) —
barriers, the review sequence, exit selection, the driver-persists route — are
``test_kb_driver_buildout.py``'s: that file owns the only stages this table
still has rows for, and duplicating its scenario scaffold here would be a
second answer to a question it already has one for.

What is left here is the vocabulary those scenarios are built from and two
contracts that hold over the whole step table rather than over any one stage:
every row has a handler, and every row's slots compose the template it is
shipped with.
