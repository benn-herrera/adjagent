"""The 2026-09-02 regression, replayed.

The claim under test: **the 23/23 assertion passes, every title binds to its own
id, and ``clm-07687j`` is present.** That is the program's whole claim as one
executable arithmetic, and it is asserted twice here, at two different depths,
because one layer cannot carry both halves of it.

**Why two layers.** The test must feed the same values — 23 ids, titles,
confidences, rationales, depends-on sets — through the API. No op accepts an
id for an insert: ops mint. The ids are therefore replayable as
*test data* but not as *op inputs*, and the two readings are split rather than
one of them being quietly dropped:

* :class:`TestByteLevelReplay` drives ``render`` + ``store`` directly with the
  **recorded** ids. Here an id is a fixture value, not an agent-supplied one, and
  what the layer proves is that the renderer/store pair reproduces a correct
  register for the exact 2026-09-02 population: 23 claim markers, 23 claim
  records, every title bound to its own id, ``clm-07687j`` present and parseable.
  This is where the named id lives, because it is the only layer in which that
  literal id can appear on disk at all.
* :class:`TestEndToEndReplay` drives ``ops`` with the same titles, rigors,
  rationales and depends-on sets, minting fresh ids. Identity of ids is
  unavailable by construction, so the graph is compared **up to the renaming**:
  the depends-on edge set read back, translated through the mint map, must equal
  the recorded one. Isomorphism is the strongest statement available,
  and it is the statement that matters — what was lost on 2026-09-02 was a node
  and its in-edges, not a particular six characters.

**The values are extracted, never transcribed.** Hand-copying 23 titles,
confidences and rationales into this file would re-import, into the test, the
byte-fidelity demand the API exists to remove — and a transcription error would
show up as a passing test over a corpus nobody replayed. :func:`_load_recorded`
instead performs the *inverse of the defect* — it transposes each ``<!-- id: … -->``
marker back below its own ``## `` heading, which is the one-line difference
between what the agent wrote and what the reader needed — and then reads the
values out with the **production parsers**. So the intended values are defined by
the toolchain's own reader over repaired bytes, not by this file's opinion of
them.

**What the corpus actually carries**, faithfully replayed rather than tidied:
``part4``'s rationale opens with a stray ``|`` (a YAML block scalar the register
author wrote and the reader does not strip) and its depends-on bullets are prose
citations that resolve to zero edges. Both are replayed exactly as the reader
returns them. A replay that silently improved its input would be proving
something about a corpus that never existed.

**Not re-asserted here.** ``test_writeapi_regression_fixture.py`` already holds
the frozen bytes to their sha256s and asserts that they still parse to 18 records
— the 18 half of this arithmetic. This file asserts the 23 half and nothing about
the fixture's own integrity.

**No test asserts a report string's wording** — only status tokens, exit
codes, named identities and counts. Every count here is a census of the frozen
corpus, not a bound this program authored.

    a quote cannot abut the closing delimiter; the newline the parser then
    leaves on the value is collapsed away by the renderer and by the readback
    comparison alike. ``_assert_corpus_shape`` has already refused a value
    carrying ``'''``, the one sequence no literal block can hold.
