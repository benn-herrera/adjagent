"""Mode dispatch and exit-code translation, through the shipped entry point.

The property under test: no invocation terminates without a baton — including
the paths that never reach the sequencer, which are exactly the ones where
the driver is least able to explain itself.

Its second half, once a run directory exists: no run terminates without its
report either. ``exit.json`` and ``cadence.jsonl`` are the run directory's own
record of how the run ended, and the endings that most need them — a kill, a
boundary check, an exception nobody named — are the ones that used to leave the
directory with a pid file and nothing else.
