"""Tests for the authored-id inventory and the id minter.

``kb_index_lib.scan_authored_ids`` is the inventory a mint-bearing re-entry
checks against: it must see every authored ``clm-`` / ``exp-`` / ``sup-`` id
using the authored Markdown alone, and must be unaffected by the state of the
derived ``.index/``. The fixture below reproduces the state that motivated it —
registers populated with dozens of authored ids while every ``.index/*.jsonl``
sits at zero bytes — where an inventory read from ``.index/`` would conclude
"no existing ids" and mint a second, colliding set.

``kb_index_lib.scan_duplicate_register_ids`` is the mint-boundary question the
inventory cannot answer, for a structural reason: the inventory is keyed by id,
so a second register entry for an id already keyed is dropped rather than
reported. Both scans walk the same registers under the same exclusion rules.

``kb_schema.mint_id`` is exercised in process, against the inventory above:
that pairing is the whole of the mint boundary now that ids are born inside the
insert op and no standalone minting command survives.
