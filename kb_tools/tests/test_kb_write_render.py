"""The render module's contract, as tests.

Four questions.

**Is every rendered shape byte-stable, and is it the shape we meant?** One
committed golden per shape under ``fixtures/writeapi-render-golden/``, produced
by the renderers in :data:`_GOLDENS` and byte-compared. A golden is the only
instrument that catches a change nobody meant to make: every other test here
asserts a property this seat chose to assert, and a regression outside that set
is invisible to all of them. Each shape is additionally rendered twice and the
two runs compared, because a golden that matched a nondeterministic renderer
once would prove nothing about the next run.

**Is the renderer actually pure?** ``render.py``'s import set is read out of its
AST and checked against a closed allowlist. The negative constraint — reads no
files, knows no paths — is load-bearing (it is what keeps one module the only
composer of metadata bytes), and a negative constraint with no instrument is a
wish.

**Are the derived-field placeholders the ones refresh recognizes?** The
requirement is that an inserted entry carry the *identity* value of each derived
field, so the first refresh over it either fills the slot or leaves it
byte-identical. All three constants live in ``kb_schema``, which
``render`` may import and every other writer already does, so the question is
now answered by **object identity** — asserted with ``assertIs`` below, against
``kb_schema`` on this side and against what the production writers return on the
other. What identity cannot cover is asserted against refresh's own *matchers*,
which are separate objects that could still drift from what they match — the
solidity line against the pattern that *replaces* it, the annotation against
the pattern that *substitutes* it.

**Does the prose collapse defeat the truncation class it exists to defeat?**
A rationale whose text contains a line beginning ``- confidence:`` is
representable: collapsed to one physical line, the reader's key list
(``kb_index_lib.py:985``) no longer matches at a line start. The fixture asserts
the stored text equals the collapsed supplied text through the real parser.

The blank-line class is **not** asserted here. It is refused by ``values.py``,
and its fixture lives in ``test_kb_write_values.py``; this module's renderers
may assume single-paragraph input.
