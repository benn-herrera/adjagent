"""Cross-tree consistency tests for the single-sourced schema vocabulary.

The build-band ladder used to be encoded three times — twice on the build side
(``kb_index_lib.derive_build_band`` / ``_BUILD_STATUS_BANDS``) and once on the
query side (``kb_cmd/index.py::BUILD_BANDS``) — with nothing tying them. These
tests pin all three to the single source, :data:`kb_schema.BUILD_BAND_LADDER`,
so a future edit to one rung that forgets another fails loudly here.

The query side is a normal package, imported directly as ``kb_tools.kb_cmd.index``.

The same shape covers the KB's navigation convention: the node filenames
and the up-link marker had four spellings across the survey validator, the driver
and the verifier, and :class:`TestNavigationConventionSingleSourced` pins each to
``kb_index_lib``'s.

And the same shape again for the node-kind vocabulary, which had no single
statement at all until :data:`kb_schema.NODE_KINDS`:
:class:`TestNodeKindVocabularySingleSourced`.
