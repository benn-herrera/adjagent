"""The single composer of KB metadata bytes.

Every metadata byte the write API emits is composed here and nowhere else. The
failure this API exists to remove is not a bad value: a correctly minted id,
a correct title and a correct rationale still lose the node outright if the
id marker sits on the wrong side of its ``##`` heading. Layout is not a thing
inference should be asked to get right, so layout lives in one module with no
inputs but values.

**Purity, binding.** This module reads no files,
knows no paths, and holds no validation. It is values → text, total and pure.
It imports :mod:`kb_tools.kb_schema` and the standard library's :mod:`re` and
:mod:`dataclasses`, and nothing else — no :mod:`pathlib`, no :mod:`os`, no
:mod:`kb_index_lib`. ``test_kb_write_render.py`` asserts the import set
structurally, because a negative constraint with no instrument is a wish.

Well-formedness (grammar, closed vocabularies, inherited value domains) is
``values.py``'s; existence and uniqueness are ``ops.py``'s against the store.
Nothing here refuses, substitutes, defaults, or repairs. **The one
permitted transform is whitespace-run collapse inside a single-paragraph prose
field** (:func:`collapse_prose`) — the parser's own ``_normalize_text``
semantics applied at write time, so what is stored is what the reader returns.

**Derived fields are written at their placeholder identity and never at a
value.** ``solidity``, the ``(solidity …)`` bullet annotation, and the
leaf-references footer are ``refresh``'s; this module emits the exact bytes
``refresh`` recognizes so that the first refresh over a freshly inserted entry
either fills the slot or leaves it byte-identical. The placeholders are
required rather than optional: refresh *replaces* a ``- solidity:`` line and a
``(solidity …)`` annotation and does not insert either, so an entry rendered
without those slots would never receive a value.

**The grammar this output must satisfy** is ``kb_index_lib``'s parsers, and the
load-bearing details are these:

* A register entry is ``## <title>`` **then** ``<!-- id: … -->``. The parser
  binds a marker to the *preceding* ``## `` heading; a marker above its heading
  binds to the previous entry's title or to nothing at all, which is exactly
  how an id goes missing with zero verifier output.
* ``- rationale:`` is **single-paragraph by grammar**. The fold breaks on a
  blank line, and on a continuation line beginning with another known key, both
  *before* normalization runs. Collapsing the value to one physical line
  defeats the second class outright. The first class — a value carrying a blank
  line — is refused by ``values.py``, never collapsed here.
* ``- no-edge:`` is not in either fold's key list, so it is rendered **above**
  ``- depends-on:`` / ``- rationale:`` / ``- strengthen-by:``; placed after any
  of them it is silently swallowed into that field's value.
* A support entry's ``- supports:`` staging block is read by TWO graders and
  satisfies both. ``kb_index_lib.parse_support_quality_entries`` already carries
  ``supports`` in both of its fold-break key lists (``:1159``, ``:1174``), so
  the block terminates that entry's ``rationale`` and ``depends-on`` folds
  correctly wherever it sits — which is also the clearest evidence in the tree
  that the staging home was designed for rather than tolerated. The staging
  reader (``kb_index_lib.parse_register_staged_supports``) is the binding
  constraint: it ends the block at the next sibling ``- `` bullet, so the pairs
  must follow their opener with **nothing between them**.
* It is rendered **directly under the rigor line** for two reasons that are not
  aesthetic. There it is always closed by an explicit sibling — ``- solidity:``
  is emitted unconditionally — rather than running to the end of the entry and
  relying on the next entry's id marker to close it, which is what a block
  rendered last would do. And it sits above every derived line, so no update
  op's replaced span and no ``refresh`` rewrite ever crosses it.
* A depends-on bullet's target lives in its *head* — the text before the first
  ``  — `` (a real em-dash, U+2014) or the first `` (``. A hyphen where the
  em-dash belongs extends the head over the title and mints phantom edges from
  every id in it.

      the cited work rests on is outside this corpus too.
    * **no leaf-references footer**, because no leaf hosts a work: an external
      work is cited by the claims that rest on it, not contained by a document.

    **The canonical output shape is the inline list** — ``claims: [clm-aaaaaa,
    clm-bbbbbb]`` — one of the three the reader accepts (inline, bracket-
    wrapped across lines, and YAML bullets). It is chosen because it is the
    shape refresh's own field writer emits when it replaces or inserts a list
    field, so a block this module writes and a block refresh rewrites are the
    same shape rather than two; and because it occupies one physical line, so
    the reader's multi-line span rule never has to be exercised on our output.
    The other two shapes stay readable and are never written.

    ``no-claim``'s reason and ``path-stable``'s label are emitted
    double-quoted. The reader strips exactly one outer quote pair before typing
    the value, so the quoted form round-trips any single-line text — including
    one that would otherwise type as the boolean ``true`` or as a bracketed
    list. Both are free-text document attributes the reader types generically
    (``kb_index_lib._frontmatter_value``); neither carries a vocabulary or a
    length this API could inherit, so it authors neither.

    Field order is ``kind``, ``path-stable``, the primary field (``claims`` or
    ``no-claim``), the additive ``experiments`` reference list, then one block
    per hosted experiment and support node. Repeated ``exp-id:`` / ``sup-id:``
    keys each open their own fan-out block: a container hosts any number of any
    combination of node bodies. ``path-stable`` follows ``kind`` because the two
    describe the document rather than its contents; ``refresh``'s roll-ups are
    inserted after ``kind:`` and so land between them, which no reader minds —
    the block is a mapping, not a sequence.
