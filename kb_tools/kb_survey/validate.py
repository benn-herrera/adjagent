"""The validator's checks: the derivation's own audit, shape facts, reachability, the tree diff.

Two modes over the same report vocabulary. :func:`validate_skeleton` runs the
pre-build checks against a manifest and the skeleton derived from it;
:func:`validate_build` runs the post-build checks against that skeleton's path
list and the tree on disk. Neither mode reads the other's inputs.

Three gates and one measurement. Checks 1, 3 and 4 are gates — each is true or
false from the documents themselves, by set or path-component arithmetic over
identity keys, and each reports in both directions rather than comparing counts.
Check 3 is a gate only for a caller holding a path list independent of the tree;
handed ``paths=None`` it reports ``FACT`` and gates nothing, because comparing
the tree against a walk of the tree cannot fail and reporting ``PASS`` for it
would claim a coverage the run does not have.
Check 2 is a **measurement**: it emits ``FACT`` lines and gates nothing. There is no threshold
anywhere in it, no override, and no configuration surface — a number authored before
the tool met the document cannot know the document, and a tight bound would not fail
visibly, it would coerce corpora that mutilate their own segmentation to pass. The only
constant here is a display cap on list length, which is about report length rather than
about the document.

**What used to be here, and why it is not.** Five checks — coverage, containment,
no-bisection, no-stitching and domain ownership — verified that a *hand-authored*
mapping of source sections onto KB paths tiled the source without gaps, overlaps
or cuts through a theorem. There is no such mapping: ``skeleton.derive`` places
every section at exactly one path, taking the document's own segmentation whole,
so none of those five has a way to fail that is not a fault in that function.
What replaced them is check 1 — the derivation compared against its own input,
which is the same question asked where it can still be answered wrongly.

**This module never reads LaTeX and never opens a ``.tex``.** Its inputs are a
manifest, a derived skeleton, a list of KB paths, and — post-build — the Markdown
tree those paths name.

Design-time reachability has no tree on disk to read the KB's navigation convention
from, so it reads it from ``kb_index_lib`` — the node filenames and the up-link
marker, imported rather than restated, so that what this module checks and what the
driver writes cannot drift apart.

**No downgrade path.** :func:`exit_code` is 0 iff no ``FAIL``; it takes no
argument that could change that, and neither entry point takes one that could arm a
measurement into a gate or disarm a gate into a measurement.

**Report order.** Pre-build findings come back in check order — 1, 2, 4 — and
post-build findings in theirs — 3, 4. Within a gate check they
are sorted by ``(check, detail)``, where every detail begins with the offending
identity: a section id, a KB path, or a ``file:line-line`` coordinate. Check 2's
``FACT`` lines are ordered by the distribution they report (leaves descending by
size, then depth, then fan-out), because that ordering is the report's content rather
than an incidental arrangement.
