"""Stage 3 — write the tree and its assets, then run the gates.

A failure stops. There is no fix loop, because there is no seat to run one: every
check here compares one mechanical product against another, so a red gate is a
defect in this stage or in its input, and neither is repaired by asking.

What the build writes under ``kb-root/`` is a directory tree of Markdown and the
image assets those documents embed, and **nothing else** — no ``.index/``, no
frontmatter block, no ``claims:`` key, no id or claim-quality marker. A document
carries body text, a heading, an up-link, and — for an index — a child list. The
claim graph is a later stage's, and it reads this tree as its sole input.

The pandoc version is recorded in the report rather than in the tree, for the
same reason: a version stamp in a document is a build artifact in a space that
holds none. A tree that differs from the last one is diagnosable from the run
that produced it.
