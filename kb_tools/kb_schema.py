"""Single source of the KB metadata-schema vocabulary for the KB toolchain.

Both the build-side scripts (``kb_tools/``) and the read-side query package
(``kb_tools/kb_cmd/``) derive the KB's schema vocabulary — the build-band ladder
and the id grammar — from this module rather than re-typing the literals
themselves. It is the definition of that vocabulary rather than a copy of one,
and is anchored beside :mod:`kb_util` in the ``kb_tools`` package (the single source of
path truth), so any consumer imports it directly as ``from kb_tools import
kb_schema``.

Four vocabularies live here:

* the **build-band ladder** — the ordered solidity → (slug, status-phrase,
  display-label) mapping written into each claim's ``build_band`` field by the
  derived-index pipeline and rendered by the query dashboard,
* the **id grammar** — the ``[a-z0-9]{6}`` hash alphabet and the ``clm`` / ``exp``
  / ``sup`` kind tokens that make up a canonical node id,
* the **node-kind vocabulary** — :data:`NODE_KINDS`, every value a
  ``node_type`` takes, which a census, a breakdown, a union or an ordering
  iterates rather than spelling, and
* the **derived-field placeholders** — the identity value of each field
  ``refresh`` computes and nothing else may.

Stdlib only.
