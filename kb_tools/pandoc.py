"""The one module that knows how LaTeX is read.

Everything the package learns from a LaTeX source comes back through these four
calls, and nothing else in it names the ``pandoc`` binary or builds an argv for
it. Replacing the reader is then one module's rewrite rather than the package's
goal;
``tests/test_binary_monopoly.py`` is what says the monopoly still holds on each
run.

The binary is assumed present on the system. This module neither installs nor
vendors it, and an absent one is :exc:`PandocMissingError` naming what to do —
never the ``FileNotFoundError`` subprocess would otherwise raise from the middle
of a build.

**Three of pandoc's behaviours are load-bearing here, and each loses content at
exit 0 with at most a stderr line to show for it. All three measured against
pandoc 3.11:**

* **``-s`` on the Markdown route is required, not cosmetic.** Without it the
  whole metadata channel — abstract, title, author, date — is dropped and stderr
  is empty. With it those arrive as a YAML block at the head of the output,
  already rendered by the same document-wide pass as the body. So
  :func:`to_markdown` sets it and offers no say in the matter.
* **``--bibliography`` is repeatable and pandoc merges what it is given**, so
  ``bibliographies`` is a set of files rather than a choice among them. Citeproc
  renders only the entries a document actually cites, so a file in the set
  carrying nothing this source cites contributes nothing to the output — an
  uncited entry is inert, not a competing answer. Where one key is defined
  twice, the first file given wins, which is what makes the **order** the
  caller's to fix: a caller that discovered its files rather than being handed
  them sorts them, so two runs over one corpus resolve the same way.
* **``--citeproc`` and the citation-key flag are one decision.** ``--citeproc``
  used to be *what makes a citation reach the output at all*, so its absence
  deleted every citation silently — a bib-less corpus built a document with no
  citations in it and nothing said so. The filter now owns citation rendering
  (``kb_docgraph/authored_blocks.lua``), so a citation survives either way and
  the cost of no bibliography is resolution, not existence. What the condition
  still decides is the **third** flag: :data:`CITATION_KEYS_ONLY_FLAG` is passed
  exactly when ``--citeproc`` is not, because it tells the filter to render the
  key itself where nothing will resolve it. One condition, three flags, decided
  in one place — a caller that set two of them and forgot the third would be
  back to silent deletion.
* **``\\input`` resolves against the invoking process's working directory** —
  not the source file's directory, and ``--resource-path`` does not cover it. A
  volume root converted from anywhere else loses its own parts to a stderr
  warning. ``working_directory`` is how a caller says where the volume lives;
  filter and bibliography paths are resolved here against *this* process's
  directory, so setting it cannot move them.

Pandoc writing to stderr on an otherwise successful run is how the third of
those, and an unresolvable citation key, announce themselves — so any such
output is logged at WARNING rather than dropped. Judging it belongs to the
caller wherever a caller can judge it: a build's partition check is what turns
lost content into a failure.

**One warning is judged here instead, because no caller can judge it.** An
include pandoc could not load takes its file's content out of the parse
entirely, so the AST, the rendering and the tree all agree about a document
that never had it and every check downstream compares two halves of the same
absence. There is nothing left to compare, and the stderr line is the whole of
the evidence — so :exc:`PandocIncludeError` is raised at exit 0, on the text.

Stdlib only.

#: The binary, spelled once for the whole package.
BINARY = "pandoc"

#: Pandoc's own exit code for a bibliography it could not parse. An exit code and
#: not a message match: the message is prose pandoc is free to reword, and what
#: reads it has to tell this failure from an unparseable *source*, which arrives
#: on the same channel and exits 64. Measured against pandoc 3.11.
_BIBLIOGRAPHY_EXIT = 25

#: Pandoc's own warning for a file it was told to include and could not read.
#: There is no exit code behind it — the reader carries on with the file's
#: content simply absent and exits 0 — so this is a message match, and the
#: opposite decision from :data:`_BIBLIOGRAPHY_EXIT` above for the opposite
#: reason: there, an exit code existed and prose would have been the fragile
#: reading; here, prose is the only reading there is.
#:
#: Narrowed as far as the message allows, so a reworded one stops matching
#: rather than matching something else: the ``[WARNING]`` level, pandoc's whole
#: sentence, and a source position of its own shape closing the line. The
#: target is greedy against that fixed tail, so a filename carrying " at " does
#: not split the match early.
#:
#: **The position's filename is optional because this module's sources arrive on
#: stdin**, which pandoc has no name for: the same warning reads ``at main.tex
#: line 112 column 23`` for a file argument and ``at line 112 column 23`` here,
#: and a pattern demanding the name would match nothing on the only route the
#: package uses. Measured against pandoc 3.11.

#: The metadata flag telling the Lua filter to render each citation's key
#: itself, set exactly when no ``--citeproc`` will run to render anything.
#: Spelled here and in ``kb_docgraph/authored_blocks.lua``, and held equal by

#: the two sides cannot import each other.
CITATION_KEYS_ONLY_FLAG = "kb-citation-keys-only"

#: The metadata key carrying a ``\newtheorem`` internal-name → display-name
#: mapping to the filter, which needs it and cannot obtain it: pandoc consumes
#: the preamble, so the declaration reaches no filter — not as a ``RawBlock``,
#: not in ``meta``, not as an attribute on the Div it classes. The caller reads
#: it off the source, which is the same shape :data:`CITATION_KEYS_ONLY_FLAG`
#: has and for the same reason.
#:
#: **The value is JSON**, not a delimited list: an internal name may carry a
#: ``*`` (``\newtheorem{lem*}``) and a display name a space (``Test example``),
#: so a hand-rolled separator would be a parser with a corpus that breaks it.
