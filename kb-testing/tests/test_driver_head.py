"""The build's head, against a repository holding sources and no ``kb-root/``.

The state under test is the one the launch command is run against: a consuming
repository carrying the installed toolchain, its LaTeX sources, and no KB at
all. Nothing is faked. The document graph converts the staged corpus through the
real reader, ``graph-init`` seeds the spine for real, the declared claim-graph
pass runs over the tree that produced, every stage's coverage check runs, and
every boundary is a real commit in a real repository — so a green here says the
head's stages actually produce what the tail assumes it was handed.

**The walk stops before ``claims-discovered``.** That stage spends one inference
per awaiting document, and the model it spends is ``kb_claimgraph``'s own — no
flag of this driver replaces it, so a suite that walked into it would spend
inference on every run. ``stages`` is the seam ``run.execute`` already declares
for exercising part of the table.

**One walk here goes the whole way, and spends nothing to do it.** Under
``--no-inference`` every row that would cost a model call is dropped, so a fresh
entry walks past both claim-graph stages and closes the build out — the only way
this suite reaches them at all. That walk has a consuming repository of its own,
because it advances a ledger every other test in this file reads at the cut.

The corpus is two volume roots rather than all of them: what is proved here is
that the driver drives the front ends, and the front ends' own coverage is
``test_docgraph_build.py``'s.
